When India A set the 168-run target for them this afternoon, after effectively recovering from 11 for 5, it seemed like we had a tricky chase in the offing. That was asserted further when Prasidh struck twice in two balls. But Konstas shone brilliantly, never looked like someone with lack of experience. And then Webster walked in in a tricky situation to see the side through for a second game in a row. Timely performances, will they have any bearing on Australia's Test squad?</p></div><div class="ds-hover-child ds-ml-auto ds-mr-1"><div></div></div></div><div class="ds-hover-parent lg:hover:ds-bg-ui-fill-translucent ds-select-none lg:ds-select-auto ds-flex ds-items-start ds-relative"><div class="ds-grow"><p class="ci-html-content ds-py-2 ds-px-3 xl:ds-pr-12">For India A, Jurel was the brightest spot, scoring half-century in both the innings in adverse situations. He was calm, composed and his shot selection stood out. He is part of the India Test squad, will these performances at the MCG make India play him as a specialist batter? Ahead of perhaps Rahul and Sarfaraz? Prasidh also came off with an enhanced reputation, using the lengths smartly and also returning a few crucial wickets. He could be vying for the third seamer's spot in the XI and his batting could also be taken into consideration, in case the fight is real close</p></div><div class="ds-hover-child ds-ml-auto ds-mr-1"><div></div></div></div><div class="ds-hover-parent lg:hover:ds-bg-ui-fill-translucent ds-select-none lg:ds-select-auto ds-flex ds-items-start ds-relative"><div class="ds-grow"><p class="ci-html-content ds-py-2 ds-px-3 xl:ds-pr-12">That is all we have from the MCG tonight.

When India A set the 168-run target for them this afternoon, after effectively recovering from 11 for 5, it seemed like we had a tricky chase in the offing. That was asserted further when Prasidh struck twice in two balls. But Konstas shone brilliantly, never looked like someone with lack of experience. And then Webster walked in in a tricky situation to see the side through for a second game in a row. Timely performances, will they have any bearing on Australia's Test squad?"},{"type":"HTML","html":"For India A, Jurel was the brightest spot, scoring half-century in both the innings in adverse situations. He was calm, composed and his shot selection stood out. He is part of the India Test squad, will these performances at the MCG make India play him as a specialist batter? Ahead of perhaps Rahul and Sarfaraz? Prasidh also came off with an enhanced reputation, using the lengths smartly and also returning a few crucial wickets. He could be vying for the third seamer's spot in the XI and his batting could also be taken into consideration, in case the fight is real close"},{"type":"HTML","html":"That is all we have from the MCG tonight.
