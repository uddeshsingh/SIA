This digital edition of Sony&#039;s PlayStation 5 console has a slimmer build than launch models and eschews a disc drive, but comes with a DualSense controller, 1,000 V-Bucks, and a few Fortnite cosmetics.PS5 Slim Disc Edition Fortnite Bundle: $425 at Amazon (was $500). This slim version of Sony&#039;s PlayStation 5 console has a disc drive for playing physical games and comes with a DualSense controller, 1,000 V-Bucks, and a handful of Fortnite cosmetics.Microsoft Xbox Series S 512GB: $250 at Target (was $300). This entry-level Xbox allows players access to the Xbox library and ecosystem, albeit with a few performance compromises. Comes with an Xbox Core Wireless Gaming Controller.Microsoft Xbox Series X 1TB: $400 at Best Buy (was $450). Microsoft&#039;s top-of-the-line Xbox, the Xbox Series X can play the console&#039;s entire library at maximum fidelity. Comes with an Xbox Core Wireless Gaming Controller.Meta Quest 3S (256GB): $399 at Amazon with free $30 digital credit. While Meta&#039;s freshly released budget revamp of the Meta Quest 3 isn&#039;t exactly on sale at the moment, you can snag its higher capacity model in a bundle with Batman: Arkham Shadow and a $30 Amazon gift card (with code QUEST30 at checkout) if you act fast.PlayStation VR2: $349 at Amazon (was $550). This massive deal is so large that Amazon&#039;s website can&#039;t actually display it properly. Right now, you can get Sony&#039;s second VR headset for $250 off its launch price, which will grant PS5 owners access to Sony&#039;s PSVR 2 library (though oddly enough, not PSVR 1 titles) and PC owners a new way to play their SteamVR games. This isn&#039;t exactly a console in the traditional sense, as it&#039;s not standalone&mdash; you&#039;ll need either a PS5 or a PC to use it. Amazon Fire TV 4K Max with Xbox Core Wireless Controller and 1 Month Xbox Game Pass Ultimate: $80 at Amazon (was $142). This bundle will snag you Amazon&#039;s best streaming stick plus an Xbox controller and 1 month of Xbox Game Pass Ultimate, turning it into a full-on cloud gaming device. It&#039;s not exactly a console in the traditional sense, but it&#039;ll get the job done, and is much more affordable (at least until the subscription fees start adding up)The best Cyber Monday game controller sales\n    \n    \n            \n                Sony - PlayStation 5 - DualSense Wireless Controller - White\n                \n                                \n                                            \n                            \n    \n        \n            $54.00\n                            at Amazon\n                    \n                    \n            \n            \n            $74.99\n            Save $20.99\n        \n    \n                            \n                        \n                        \n                            \n    Get Deal\n\n                        \n                                    \n            \n            \n                \n                                            \n                                    \n            \n            \n                \n                                            \n                                    \n            \n            \n                                    \n                        \n    Get Deal\n\n                    \n                    \n                        \n    \n        \n            $54.00\n                            at Amazon\n                    \n                    \n            \n            \n            $74.99\n            Save $20.99\n        \n    \n                    \n                            \n        \n\nEven if you&#039;ve already got a console, you always need more controllers:PlayStation DualSense Wireless Controller: $54 at Amazon (was $75). PS5 controllers can be a bit more finicky to connect to other devices than Xbox controllers, but have improved greatly in this regard over the years, and come with plenty of extra haptics that might justify their higher price tag to some gamers.Hori Split Pad Pro for Nintendo Switch: $42.49 at Best Buy (was $50). The Hori Split Pad Pro sometimes feels like a downright necessary upgrade for playing the Switch in portable mode, making it far more comfortable to hold over extended periods.CRKD Nitro Deck+ for Nintendo Switch: $50 at Amazon (was $70). This alternate Joy-Con replacement acts as a full external shell for the Nintendo Switch, essentially giving it a much more Steam Deck style look and feel.8BitDo Ultimate Bluetooth Controller: $48 at Amazon (was $70). This is a reliable third-party alternative to the official Nintendo Switch Pro Controller, with both Bluetooth and 2.4 GHz connectivity, plus motion controls, back paddles, macro compatibility, and durable Hall Effect sticks.Xbox Core Wireless Gaming Controller: $40 at Amazon (was $60). Almost no video game accessory is as versatile as the basic Xbox controller, which can work across a slew of devices and has a standard layout that most games recognize immediately.Backbone One Mobile Gaming Controller: $70 at Amazon (was $100). These days, mobiles phones are practically gaming consoles in their own right, but controlling one with a touchscreen can be a pain. The Backbone One is a longstanding favorite phone controller among mobile gaming enthusiasts.The best Cyber Monday gaming laptop sales\n    \n    \n            \n                GIGABYTE AORUS 17: 17.3&amp;quot; Thin Bezel QHD 2560x1440 240Hz, NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4070 Laptop GPU 8GB GDDR6, Intel Core i7-13700H, 16GB DDR5 RAM, 1TB SSD, Win11 Home (AORUS 17 BSF-73US654SH),Black\n                \n                                \n                                            \n                            \n    \n        \n            $1,542.24\n                            at Amazon\n                    \n                    \n            \n            \n            $1,749.00\n            Save $206.76\n        \n    \n                            \n                        \n                        \n                            \n    Get Deal\n\n                        \n                                    \n            \n            \n                \n                                            \n                                    \n            \n            \n                \n                                            \n                                    \n            \n            \n                                    \n                        \n    Get Deal\n\n                    \n                    \n                        \n    \n        \n            $1,542.24\n                            at Amazon\n                    \n                    \n            \n            \n            $1,749.00\n            Save $206.76\n        \n    \n                    \n                            \n        \n\nConsoles aren&#039;t the only way to game, and this Cyber Monday has a lot of great deals on gaming laptops for those would would rather play on PC.Dell Alienware m16 R2 Gaming Laptop with Intel Core Ultra 9 chip: $1,300 at Dell (was $1,700).

<p>Since the release of the Steam Deck, handheld gaming PCs have gotten a lot more mainstream.
