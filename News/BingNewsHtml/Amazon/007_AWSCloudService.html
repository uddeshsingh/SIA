        <p>IT solution provider heavyweight CDW Monday said it has acquired Mission Cloud Services in a move to expand its partnership with Amazon Web Services.</p>
        <p>With the acquisition, CDW, ranked No. 5 on the <a href="https://www.crn.com/sp-500/sp2024-details?c=5">CRN 2024 Solution Provider 500</a>, and Mission Cloud Services, ranked No. 108, will complement CDW Digital Velocity, which is the company’s cloud, data, AI, and software platform engineering organization.</p>
        <p>Mission Cloud Services and CDW’s existing expertise together will form CDW’s dedicated AWS practice, CDW said.</p>

        <p>CDW was not able to provide more information on the transaction in response to a CRN inquiry.</p>
        <p>The CDW Digital Velocity business currently provides services around automated infrastructure, practical DevOps, modern cloud, software and enterprise architecture, agile team integration, and rapid resourcing of necessary talent.</p>
        <p>Mission Cloud Services, which was founded seven years ago, provides SMB and midmarket AWS customers with custom solutions and guidance for professional services, end-to-end cloud services, and security. The company is also an AWS-certified GenAI partner, helping its customers transform customer data with AI and machine learning with comprehensive security for AWS environments, CDW said.</p>
        <p>No dollar value for the acquisition was provided.</p>
        <p>Until its acquisition by CDW, Mission Cloud Services was owned by Great Hill Partners, a Boston-based private equity firm that has raised over $12 billion of commitments and invested in over 100 companies.</p>
        <p>Great Hill Partners first invested in Mission Cloud Services in 2017, and in the next two years acquired three other IT firms to build what the private equity company called in a statement “the largest independent AWS managed services company in the United States.”</p>
        <p><a href="https://www.crn.com/news/channel-news/2024/cdw-ceo-challenging-demand-federal-funding-become-2024-headwinds">CDW Chair and CEO Christine Leahy</a> said in a prepared statement that Mission Cloud Services will accelerate CDW’s own cloud services business.</p>
        <p>“The acquisition of Mission accelerates our three-part growth strategy by augmenting our cloud services and enhancing our ability to deliver customer-centric outcomes across the full technology solutions stack and lifecycle. We look forward to welcoming the talented Mission team to CDW and leveraging their robust cloud, security, and AI expertise to lead the market and deliver on our purpose – to make technology work so people can do great things.”</p>
        <p>Becoming part of CDW is an important part of scaling Mission Cloud Services’ dedicated AWS practice, said Simon Anderson, chairman, founder, and CEO of the Los Angeles area-based company (pictured above), in a prepared statement: “As an AWS Premier Tier Partner, we are strategically positioned to help CDW's extensive customer network embrace and accelerate building on AWS and optimize their technology investments and AI-driven innovation.”</p>
