higher standard for secure, AI-powered customer interactions.</div><main class="styles_article-body__EHbE2"><div class="rich-html"><h3>The Gist</h3><ul><li><strong>AI integration.<em> </em></strong><em>Amazon Connect integrates generative AI, enhancing customer segmentation and interaction quality.</em></li><li><strong>Omnichannel expansion. </strong><em>New WhatsApp support and Salesforce integration expand omnichannel capabilities.</em></li><li><strong>Security enhancements. </strong><em>More robust security features and PCI compliance bolster data protection and trust.</em> </li></ul><p>AWS recently announced a significant expansion of <a rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="Amazon Connect" href="https://aws.amazon.com/connect/">Amazon Connect</a>, introducing generative AI capabilities, Salesforce integration and enhanced security features to advance customer engagement, operational efficiency and data compliance. These updates aim to improve customer engagement, optimize operational efficiency and strengthen data compliance. </p><p>Key innovations include advanced self-service tools powered by Amazon Q, PCI-compliant chat interactions and native WhatsApp support for omnichannel communication. Together, these features position Amazon Connect as a powerful option for businesses eager to deliver personalized, secure and efficient customer experiences.</p><h2>Generative AI-Powered Enhancements</h2><p>At <a rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="AWS re:Invent" href="https://reinvent.awsevents.com/">AWS re:Invent</a>, Amazon Connect introduced a wide range of updates aimed at advancing customer engagement and optimizing contact center operations through innovative technologies. These updates reflect Amazon Connect’s focus on addressing critical business needs, such as improving customer interactions, streamlining workflows and ensuring robust data protection.  </p><p>For businesses relying on <a title="contact center solutions" target="_blank" href="https://www.cmswire.com/contact-center/what-is-contact-center-as-a-service-ccaas/" rel="noopener noreferrer">contact center solutions</a>, these enhancements represent an opportunity to elevate customer experience while boosting efficiency. As generative AI and integrated communication platforms become essential for modern customer service, Amazon Connect’s updates position it as a viable option for businesses that are looking to stay competitive.</p><p>Amazon Connect’s latest updates take advantage of <a title="generative AI" target="_blank" href="https://www.cmswire.com/digital-experience/generative-ai-timeline-9-decades-of-notable-milestones/" rel="noopener noreferrer">generative AI</a> to deliver sophisticated tools that enhance customer targeting, interaction quality and operational efficiency. One standout feature is <a title="AI-driven customer segmentation" target="_blank" href="https://www.cmswire.com/content-marketing/customer-segmentation-in-an-era-of-deep-and-integrated-tech/" rel="noopener noreferrer">AI-driven customer segmentation</a> and campaign management, which allows businesses to define target audiences through simple natural language descriptions. This capability simplifies the process of identifying and reaching specific customer groups, enabling more personalized and effective marketing efforts.  </p><p>Michael Wallace, AWS solutions architecture leader for customer experience, told CMSWire that organizations often struggle to deliver relevant customer experiences due to fragmented data across disparate systems, lacking a holistic view of their customers&#x27; journey. “The generative AI capabilities in Amazon Connect address this challenge by unifying customer data to create more dynamic and context-aware interactions.&quot; </p><p>By using unified customer data and <a title="analyzing behavioral insights" target="_blank" href="https://www.cmswire.com/customer-experience/why-you-need-to-understand-customer-behavior-when-tackling-cx-feedback/" rel="noopener noreferrer">analyzing behavioral insights</a>, businesses can engage customers with precision, enhancing both the relevance and timing of interactions. &quot;For example, a retail company could use Amazon Connect to identify a customer who has recently browsed high-value items on their website but abandoned their cart. The system could then automatically trigger a personalized outreach at an optimal time,&quot; said Wallace.</p><p>While this level of personalization boosts customer satisfaction and loyalty, successfully deploying AI-powered segmentation and outreach may require businesses to address challenges such as fragmented legacy data systems and the need for skilled personnel to manage these advanced tools.</p><p>Another key enhancement is the introduction of <a rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="Amazon Q" href="https://aws.amazon.com/q/">Amazon Q</a>, which integrates with <a rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="Amazon Lex" href="https://aws.amazon.com/lex/">Amazon Lex</a> to create advanced conversational bots. Through the use of <a title="large language models (LLMs)" target="_blank" href="https://www.cmswire.com/digital-experience/what-are-large-language-models-llms-definition-types-uses/" rel="noopener noreferrer">large language models (LLMs)</a>, these bots provide smarter interactive voice response (IVR) systems and chat interfaces capable of understanding complex queries, delivering more human-like and efficient customer interactions.  </p><p>Additionally, Amazon Connect now offers automated performance evaluations and interaction categorization powered by AI. These tools streamline the assessment of agent performance, enabling businesses to focus on coaching and improvement while ensuring consistent service quality. The advanced categorization of customer interactions also provides deeper insights into customer needs and behavior, paving the way for more informed decision-making.</p><p><strong>Related Article: <a title="5 Ways Artificial Intelligence Boosts Contact Centers" target="_blank" href="https://www.cmswire.com/contact-center/5-ways-artificial-intelligence-boosts-contact-centers/" rel="noopener noreferrer">5 Ways Artificial Intelligence Boosts Contact Centers</a></strong></p><h2>Omnichannel Expansion With WhatsApp Integration</h2><p>Amazon Connect’s new WhatsApp integration further strengthens its omnichannel capabilities, enabling businesses to engage customers on one of the world’s most widely used messaging platforms. This addition allows businesses to provide seamless support and outreach directly through <a rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="WhatsApp" href="https://www.whatsapp.com/">WhatsApp</a>, complementing existing channels like SMS and <a rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="Apple Messages for Business" href="https://support.apple.com/guide/security/secure-apple-messages-for-business-sec1c603aab4/web">Apple Messages for Business</a>. By integrating WhatsApp into its ecosystem, Amazon Connect enables businesses to meet customers on their preferred communication platforms, allowing more accessible and personalized interactions.  </p><p>Lara Guzik, senior product manager of Amazon Connect, told CMSWire that her company is positioning itself as a leader in omnichannel communication by focusing on three key areas: “Making it easier for companies to meet customers on their preferred channels, building out self-serve and agent-assist capabilities to accelerate issue resolution and continuing to enable personalized and proactive capabilities that delight customers.&quot;</p><p>These enhancements reflect the growing <a title="importance of omnichannel communication" target="_blank" href="https://www.cmswire.com/customer-experience/seamless-omnichannel-strategy-best-practices-for-customer-engagement/" rel="noopener noreferrer">importance of omnichannel communication</a> in modern customer service, where reaching customers where they are — and on platforms they trust — has become a cornerstone of effective engagement strategies. However, implementing these integrations may require significant upfront investments and technical expertise, particularly for businesses with legacy systems or limited digital infrastructure. Brands will need to evaluate their readiness to fully leverage these capabilities.</p><span data-sumome-listbuilder-embed-id="162cc8de435dab50d8d243a39864a608a475f1c22d18843e969ea006ee2d7af8"></span><h2>Enhanced Analytics and Bot Management</h2><p>Amazon Connect also introduced a suite of analytics and management tools designed to give businesses greater control and visibility over their contact center operations. Among these updates are new <a rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="Contact Lens dashboards" href="https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/technology/aws-health/">Contact Lens dashboards</a> for monitoring Lex-powered bots. These dashboards provide detailed insights into bot performance, enabling businesses to optimize interactions, identify areas for improvement and ensure customer satisfaction.  </p><p>The addition of self-service interaction logs further enhances transparency and operational tracking. With access to voice recordings and comprehensive interaction details, these logs were designed to enable businesses to more effectively review customer engagements, troubleshoot issues and refine their service delivery.  </p><p>&quot;Amazon Q’s dual capability in supporting both self-service interactions and agent assistance creates a more dynamic and efficient contact center environment,” said Wallace. “By seamlessly handling complex inquiries through smart self-service while empowering human agents with real-time insights, AI enables more personalized, efficient and proactive customer service.&quot;</p><p>Improvements to intraday forecasting are designed to allow businesses to compare forecasts dynamically throughout the day, enabling better resource planning and adaptation to fluctuating customer demand. This feature will help to ensure that contact centers remain appropriately staffed and ready to deliver consistent support, even during unexpected spikes in activity.  </p><p><strong>Related Article:

robust <a rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="security and compliance enhancements" href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/whitepapers/latest/aws-overview/security-and-compliance.html">security and compliance enhancements</a> to address the growing need for safe and reliable data handling in customer interactions. The platform now includes PCI-compliant features designed to safeguard sensitive information, such as personally identifiable information (PII) shared during chats. These updates help businesses ensure that sensitive customer data is managed securely, reducing the risk of breaches and maintaining trust.</p><p>&quot;With the new PCI-compliant chat interactions in Amazon Connect, contact centers across industries now benefit from enhanced security and operational efficiency,” said Wallace. “This feature is particularly critical for industries that handle higher volumes of payment card transactions, such as retail, home services and financial services.&quot;</p><p>By adhering to <a title="global data protection standards" target="_blank" href="https://www.cmswire.com/customer-experience/the-data-privacy-toolkit-first-steps-toward-a-privacy-centric-future/" rel="noopener noreferrer">global data protection standards</a>, these upgrades were put in place to strengthen compliance with regulations such as the GDPR, CCPA and other regional frameworks. This focus on secure data handling not only protects customers but also supports businesses in complying with the increasingly complex meshwork of data privacy and regulatory laws. </p><h2>Partnership With Salesforce</h2><p>Amazon Connect’s preview of its integration with Salesforce introduced connectivity between <a rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="Salesforce Contact Center" href="https://www.cloudtalk.io/salesforce-phone-integration-ga/">Salesforce Contact Center</a> and Amazon Connect’s digital channels and unified routing capabilities. The partnership helps businesses simplify customer interactions by unifying communication tools and routing capabilities into one system.</p><p>For businesses already using Salesforce, this integration offers a significant advantage. By connecting Amazon Connect’s advanced features with Salesforce’s CRM platform, businesses can enhance their customer engagement workflows, improve data synchronization and create more personalized experiences. This collaboration reflects the growing demand for interoperable solutions that maximize the value of existing technology investments while simplifying the management of complex customer service frameworks.</p><h2>Key Benefits and Business Impact</h2><p>Amazon Connect’s latest enhancements bring significant benefits for businesses, delivering improvements across customer experience, operational efficiency and security. However, the introduction of advanced technologies such as generative AI and omnichannel tools also presents challenges, such as the complexity of integration, potential resource demands for customization and the need for continuous training to ensure adoption by contact center staff.</p><p>On the operational side, features such as streamlined bot management through Contact Lens dashboards and detailed analytics for Lex-powered interactions empower businesses to make data-driven decisions. These tools optimize resource allocation, improve agent performance and provide actionable insights to fine-tune operations. </p><p>Security enhancements, including PCI-compliant chat features, strengthen businesses’ ability to <a title="safeguard sensitive customer data" target="_blank" href="https://www.cmswire.com/digital-experience/4-customer-centric-strategies-for-improving-data-privacy/" rel="noopener noreferrer">safeguard sensitive customer data</a> and comply with global data protection regulations. These updates were designed to not only protect businesses from compliance risks but also build trust with customers, ensuring long-term confidence in the platform.  </p><p><strong>Related Article: <a title="The Data Privacy Toolkit: First Steps Toward a Privacy-Centric Future" target="_blank" href="https://www.cmswire.com/customer-experience/the-data-privacy-toolkit-first-steps-toward-a-privacy-centric-future/" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Data Privacy Toolkit: First Steps Toward a Privacy-Centric Future</a></strong></p><h2>The Next Chapter for Amazon Connect </h2><p>Amazon Connect&#x27;s latest updates represent a notable step forward in contact center technology, introducing generative AI, enhanced security measures and expanded communication tools to help businesses improve customer interactions and streamline operations. <br/>By integrating WhatsApp for omnichannel support, enhancing data protection and previewing a Salesforce partnership, AWS has positioned Amazon Connect as a viable solution for addressing the evolving demands of modern customer engagement.</p><p><em><img src="/api/fontawesome/fa-regular%20fa-lightbulb.svg" alt="fa-regular fa-lightbulb" loading="lazy" class="styles_icon__1szyq" style="filter:invert(84%) sepia(1%) saturate(0%) hue-rotate(33deg) brightness(90%) contrast(87%);object-fit:cover;width:18px;height:26px;margin-bottom:-2px"/> Have a tip to share with our editorial team?

But not only AI — we get into the latest innovations in contact centers, customer support, and service even if it doesn’t include our bot friends. Let's dive into our discussion with four key takeaways.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003eTakeaway 1: Enhancing Real-Time Decision Making\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDom Nicastro:\u003c/strong\u003e Our first takeaway examines how AI is enhancing real-time decision-making capabilities, empowering agents with instant insights to better support customer interactions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBarry Cooper:\u003c/strong\u003e First of all, AI is not new for NICE. We come from a background of having billions of label interactions. And back in 2019, 2020, we launched Enlighten, which with the first few models based on those kind of labeled interactions. They were mostly around agent behaviors and CSAT, that kind of stuff.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eSo we've been in, we've been doing this now for this is our fourth year going full out, full swing on AI. Last year, we were able to integrate and include Gen AI into our AI solutions to give a nice semantic front end AI making very nice copilot, autopilot interfaces.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eBut first thing, this is not new for us. So you probably \u003ca rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://www.cmswire.com/customer-experience/nice-unveils-cxone-mpower-a-leap-in-cx-aware-ai/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"heard at Interactions\"\u003eheard at Interactions\u003c/a\u003e. You know, we have over 1,500 customers that use our AI now, billions of AI interventions on our platform happening already. So the whole theme of Interactions was CX AI realized because we get a little bit miffed by all of the hype that's out there that's not real. So if you were at Interactions, you heard from many of our customers that have deployed AI for self service, for knowledge, all that kind of stuff, and achieve great results from that already.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eSo, you know, for us, we're in kind of stage three of our AI adoption. It's very, very exciting for the company.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eI created a couple of years ago a separate AI division within NICE which is now a huge burgeoning division. We have almost every enterprise deal we close now includes AI of some kind, and at a really high level, our AI solutions focus in really three domains, three personas.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eFirst of all is kind of automated intelligence. So that's AI for the consumer, kind of replacing agents on some of the activities, some of the use cases with bots that actually work, that sound like people, that act like people, that do things very, very efficiently. This is category number one.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eCategory number two is what we call \u003ca rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://www.cmswire.com/customer-experience/transforming-customer-interactions-with-ai-augmented-cx/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"augmented intelligence\"\u003eaugmented intelligence\u003c/a\u003e. So this is AI for the agents, or for the supervisor or for the administrators that superpower those people allow them to do things they couldn't do before.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAnd finally, we have, like, AI for the CX leader. And if you've seen it, Enlightened actions, that's exactly what that is, a solution that allows CX leaders to query everything using AI, using a generative AI interface, to find out what's going on, get, you know, make skill changes, all that kind of stuff on the fly.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRelated Article: \u003ca rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://www.cmswire.com/customer-experience/ais-role-in-shaping-the-future-of-customer-experience/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"AI's Role in Shaping the Future of Customer Experience\"\u003eAI's Role in Shaping the Future of Customer Experience\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDom Nicastro:\u003c/strong\u003e Tom Laird's perspective emphasizes a crucial shift in how AI is being leveraged within contact centers—not just for customer-facing interactions, but more importantly, to transform the agent experience.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTom Laird:\u003c/strong\u003e ...And again, we've had these tools, and so many tools have been just customer facing, where AI is really the first kind of platform or group of technologies that we can really go down the funnel to to improve \u003ca rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://www.cmswire.com/customer-experience/a-4-step-recipe-for-improving-your-contact-center-agent-experience/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"agent experience\"\u003eagent experience\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eYou know, if you look at even things like auto summarization, right, while that can be, you know, kind of a handle time and then kind of just making some things a little bit easier on the KPIs, it's also making things a lot easier on the agent, right? No more memoing, no more mistakes when you're memoing, being able to maybe take a breath instead of working for that 15 seconds or 20 seconds or 30 seconds of after call work. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eEven looking at, you know, looking at \u003ca rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://www.ottoqa.com/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"OttoQA\"\u003eOttoQA\u003c/a\u003e, right, looking at those type of platforms, where, before, we would score two calls per agent per week, and if they failed one, that agent was maybe not going to get their bonus.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eBut now we have the ability to score multiple calls, up to 100% of calls, and that really paints a better picture, I think, for the agent, for that agent experience.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2\u003eTakeaway 2: Automating Routine Tasks\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDom Nicastro:\u003c/strong\u003e Our second takeaway dives into how AI is automating routine, mundane tasks, thereby freeing agents to handle more complex and emotionally nuanced interactions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKeith Farley:\u003c/strong\u003e It is a balance. I mean, we have to remember that when people reach out to us, it's often one of the worst days of their life. They've been diagnosed with a disease, maybe they've lost a loved one, maybe they've been in an accident. They could be in physical pain. So it's not like reaching out to someone to order a pizza or to book a flight, you know, or to buy a shirt. I mean, it is. It is a much deeper emotional experience.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAnd one of the things that we try to remember when we balance technology and empathy and all the buzz is AI as well it should be, because it's exciting. But the first word in AI is artificial, and sometimes what you want is authentic, not artificial. And so we try to remember, let's be authentic. Let's remember where people are coming from when they reach out to us, where their mindset is. They might be calling us from a hospital or a doctor's office or at home again, if they've been dealt some bad news. So we want to make sure that we've got a human-first approach.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eNow we do use \u003ca rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://www.cmswire.com/customer-experience/6-ai-automation-trends-in-omnichannel-cx/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"AI and automation\"\u003eAI and automation\u003c/a\u003e to handle more of the simple things. So you need to change your address, that's a job for AI. You know, you want to update some billing information or add a dependent, remove a dependent, that can be handled with self-service tools, digital tools, or AI, but when you need to talk through a diagnosis and understand your coverages, that's when we think it's probably right for most people to speak to a human. Some people still want to do it all digital, but we want to make sure that it's omnichannel, however you want to have it, we can do it, whether it's with a human or if you want to work with one of the automations.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDom Nicastro:\u003c/strong\u003e And what if the agents are the ones who are empowered to get the most out of the bots? What if the agent is the assistant to the AI bot?\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBarry Cooper:\u003c/strong\u003e And the really interesting thing is, today we talk about Enlighten being the co-pilot to the agent. You know, pretty soon the agent's going to be the co-pilot for Enlighten, and that is, you know, the bots are going to be handling a lot of the interactions, but every now and again, a bot’s going to run into trouble, and the bot’s going to put its hand up, and it's going to be the agent that gets in there and helps the bot out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eSo it's this role reversal that we see is going to happen over the next few years or so. So we're creating solutions that are actually going to enable that. So I truly believe that come three, four, or five years from now, the role of an agent is going to be turned on its head, and they'll be overseeing all these AI bots doing different things. And it's going to be very, very interesting.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRelated Article: \u003ca rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://www.cmswire.com/customer-experience/the-wrong-way-to-do-cx-automation/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"The Wrong Way to Do CX Automation\"\u003eThe Wrong Way to Do CX Automation\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eTakeaway 3: Improving Agent and Customer Experience\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDom Nicastro:\u003c/strong\u003e\u0026nbsp;For our third takeaway, we look at how contact centers are inspiring agents and customer experience by providing in-depth insights and predictive analytics, enhancing the overall service quality.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTom Laird:\u003c/strong\u003e\u0026nbsp;I'm a huge analytics person. It's been one of the biggest drivers of our business, not just from a cultural aspect, but even from a monetary aspect, with other customers, being able to really dissect and give marketing data, right, where nobody thought that that could happen. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSo, like, Enlighten actions, for me is like, how, right? It's like, you know, I don't want to look at dashboards anymore, right? I want to ask specific questions and get those answers. And I think that's the stuff that's really cool, that's really exciting, that, you know, you don't have to be that giant, smart, PhD analyst, right to do analytics, to get really deep insights into what's happening.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eSo the customer experience is, I don't want to say it's going to take care of itself, but, you know, we're working on that. The agent experience is being worked on, and I think also this analytic piece right, of really digging deep into data, because now it's not just, it's not just \u003ca rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://www.cmswire.com/customer-experience/the-troubled-migration-to-cloud-contact-centers/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"CCaaS\"\u003eCCaaS\u003c/a\u003e or telephony data, but it's your sales data, it's your marketing data. It's having all these different data sources together, and how do we really utilize that as a business-changing opportunity, instead of, again, that's where the contact center really starts to take off as a driver of business, instead of just that, the thing that answers the painful calls from customers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDom Nicastro:\u003c/strong\u003e\u0026nbsp;And when it comes to some of those key analytics, what’s top of mind for Keith?\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKeith Farley:\u003c/strong\u003e\u0026nbsp;I would say the number one that we look for is ease. And in today's world, if it's not easy, you're not going to do it. You have choices. You have selections you're going to go with. You know, the one that was easy to do.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eSo we have E-scores that are measured via post call surveys. That's the number one metric for our contact centers to say, was this easy on a scale of one to 10? How easy was this? We do look at things like, you know, average, handle time, speed to answer. You know, you have to if you're running a contact center, you need those metrics to keep the engine going. Yeah.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eBut the one that really matters at the end, it doesn't matter how quickly you answer my call are, from a metric standpoint, internally, how short the call was, right? Or for the policyholder doesn't want to spend a lot of time….was I able to accomplish what I wanted to accomplish? And was it easy? So that's the main thing for us.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2\u003eTakeaway 4: The Future of AI in Customer Service\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDom Nicastro:\u003c/strong\u003e\u0026nbsp;Our final takeaway looks forward to the future of AI in customer service, imagining the innovative applications yet to come that will further transform the contact center landscape. Let’s start with Keith.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKeith Farley:\u003c/strong\u003e\u0026nbsp;Yeah, I would say for us, it's all about claims automation. It's leveraging AI. AI can read all of the paperwork, including the doctor's handwriting, which is amazing, because humans can't read doctor's handwriting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eBut you know the ability to automate claims right now, where over 55% our claims are automated, where the computer can literally read your policy and read the hospital notes of what happened and match up exactly what the payment should be. And that means that we're going to have faster payments, higher quality payments, you know, in many cases, that are straight through the process.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eSo for us, you know, when you go back to ease and customer experience, you know, when folks have something happen, they just want to be paid, and they want to be paid quickly. And so I would say automation, and some of the things that we're doing there with AI is probably our next new frontier.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDom Nicastro:\u003c/strong\u003e\u0026nbsp;Barry says the future is simply limitless when it comes to CX.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBarry Cooper:\u003c/strong\u003e\u0026nbsp;If anyone is listening to this, you're probably in the CX space, and CX has never been as important as it is today. You know, we like to say that CX, you know, is no longer just part of the business. CX is the business now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eSo many industries, you know, become commoditized and the products, there's only so much you can do with pricing, and many of the products become the same. So the only way that organizations can differentiate themselves and win new customers is CX.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAnd you see how hot the space is right now, the amount of dollars being invested, our growth, you know, we're double digit growth now from years and years and years, you know, we've come from being a half a billion dollar company just a few years ago to approaching $3 billion now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eSo just the amount of investment, the amount of excitement. What I love is that, you know, I get to look at some of the lab stuff we're doing that's maybe two or three years away. That stuff is incredible, guys; it's going to be game changing when it comes, you know. Anyone loves to be at the forefront of revolutions. This is a \u003ca rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://www.cmswire.com/customer-experience/ai-in-customer-experience-the-impact-on-customer-journeys/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"revolution in CX\"\u003erevolution in CX\u003c/a\u003e.

A more empowered – and richer – contact center agent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTom Laird:\u003c/strong\u003e\u0026nbsp;We're in a weird spot as an industry, because I think when I look out at where even my company will be in, say, three to five years, we've turned from a contact center outsourcer that supplies agents to answer calls, to now really a CX technology partner that specializes in contact center outsourcing, right?\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eMeaning, I think that the contact center associate that now is maybe that entry level person is about to become one of the most high valued employees in your organization, because they're not going to handle that stuff as to Barry's point AI is going to take 30, 40% of all the tasks away, and it's going to leave us with these really difficult tasks that maybe 10 years from now, it starts to take care of.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eBut right now, I think that we're trying to figure out what that line is, and as in, technology is just going so fast, right? Sometimes it can be hard to figure out really, where that is. At the same point, we do have to do that. We in our initial education even how to talk, right? Like there's different everybody texts now. Like, if we have younger employees that are 20-30 years old, right, they've grown up with a cell phone their whole life, they're texting more than they're talking. So you do have to do a lot of that from a contact center agent standpoint, I think AI is trying to help with that a little bit as well.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eBut again, I think we're in a bridge point right now that we have this conversation in a couple years, I think you're going to see that contact center agent position elevated, much higher pay, doing much more difficult tasks because of what's happening on the on the AI standpoint.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2\u003eAI and the Future of Customer Service and Customer Support\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDom Nicastro:\u003c/strong\u003e\u0026nbsp;And that wraps up today's episode on where AI and innovation meet customer service.

We’ll be pulling directly from those interviews and diving into the lessons they’ve shared that go way beyond their products and into their approaches to leadership, strategy, and AI. So let’s get right into it!\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003csection\u003e\n  \u003ch2\u003eTakeaway No. 1: The Importance of Onboarding as a CMO\u003c/h2\u003e\n  \u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDom:\u003c/strong\u003e\u0026nbsp;So, let’s start with our first takeaway — onboarding as a CMO. When Kathie Johnson took on her role as the CMO of Sitecore, she came in with a really clear and structured plan for her first 90 days. Here’s what she shared with us about that process:\u003c/p\u003e\n  \u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKathie Johnson:\u003c/strong\u003e\u0026nbsp;I really built out a very detailed 30, 60, 90 day plan, which is all about the three pillars that I feel are so important when you're onboarding: people, process, which includes tools, and performance. And I spend a lot of time digging in.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eShe continues her insights on the people side, process and technology side, and performance measures.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDom:\u003c/strong\u003e\u0026nbsp;Kathie really nails the importance of making that human connection, especially when you’re new to a team. It’s not just about coming in and shaking things up. It’s about learning, building trust, and getting a real feel for the landscape before you start making big moves.\u003c/p\u003e\n  \u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMichelle:\u003c/strong\u003e\u0026nbsp;Definitely. And what I love about her approach is that it’s not just about meeting people — it’s about understanding the processes and technologies that are already in place and finding ways to optimize them. A lot of times, new CMOs just come in guns blazing, but Kathie really emphasizes getting that lay of the land first.\u003c/p\u003e\n  \u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMichelle:\u003c/strong\u003e\u0026nbsp;And speaking of onboarding, Gurdeep Dhillon from Contentstack also had some great insights on joining a team, especially in a fully remote environment. Here’s what he had to say about how he built rapport with his team from the get-go:\u003c/p\u003e\n  \u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eGurdeep Dhillon:\u003c/strong\u003e\u0026nbsp;Sometimes there's an assumption that when someone enters into a new role, especially at an executive level, especially external, that the team needs an overhaul. It's funny because what I've found is actually that's not often the case.\u003c/p\u003e\n  \u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eHe continues discussing building rapport with his team, the importance of understanding team motivations, and fostering team engagement virtually and in-person.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n  \u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMichelle:\u003c/strong\u003e\u0026nbsp;I love that Gurdeep prioritized getting to know his team face-to-face — even if it meant taking that extra step to organize an offsite early on. In a remote world, that personal connection is still so important.\u003c/p\u003e\n  \u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDom:\u003c/strong\u003e\u0026nbsp;Yeah, it’s such a key point, especially in remote settings where it’s easy to feel disconnected. And Gurdeep makes it clear that remote teams don’t have to feel distant. With some effort, you can still build that camaraderie and trust, which are essential for long-term success.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRelated Article: \u003ca rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://www.cmswire.com/digital-marketing/cmo-circle-navigating-the-onboarding-journey-a-new-cmos-approach/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"CMO Circle: Navigating the Onboarding Journey: A New CMO's Approach\"\u003eCMO Circle: Navigating the Onboarding Journey: A New CMO's Approach\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/section\u003e\n\u003csection\u003e\n  \u003ch2\u003eTakeaway No. 2: Balancing Innovation and Current Market Demands\u003c/h2\u003e\n  \u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDom:\u003c/strong\u003e\u0026nbsp;Alright, moving on to our next takeaway. One of the toughest challenges CMOs face today is balancing innovation with the actual needs of the market.

We hear so much about innovation, but what really matters is if that innovation is addressing what your customers actually need today. You can be as cutting-edge as you want, but if the market isn’t ready for it or doesn’t need it, you’re wasting resources.\u003c/p\u003e\n  \u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMichelle:\u003c/strong\u003e\u0026nbsp;Exactly. It’s that balance between forward-thinking and practical execution. Kathie’s focus on positioning and messaging as key differentiators really shows that she’s not just about chasing shiny objects — it’s about delivering what works.\u003c/p\u003e\n  \u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMichelle:\u003c/strong\u003e\u0026nbsp;Now let’s bring in Gurdeep’s take on this. He also touched on how Contentstack needed to shift from high-level messaging around innovation to more targeted, market-aligned strategies.\u003c/p\u003e\n  \u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eGurdeep Dhillon:\u003c/strong\u003e\u0026nbsp;Obviously we play in the \u003ca rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://www.cmswire.com/digital-experience/navigating-the-evolution-from-cms-to-dxp-in-the-digital-age/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"CMS space\"\u003eCMS space\u003c/a\u003e and marketing's job is to own and drive the pipeline.

I'm Dom Nicastro, Editor-in-Chief here at CMSWire, and with me is Michelle Hawley, our fantastic Senior Editor. How's it going, Michelle?\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMichelle Hawley:\u003c/strong\u003e It's going good, Dom! Excited to dive into today's topic. We’ve got some great insights from our recent video interviews. You spoke with Gautam Pantakar, the GM of Oldfield, on Beyond the Call, and I interviewed DeLu Jackson, executive VP and chief marketing officer at ADT, for CMO Circle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDom Nicastro:\u003c/strong\u003e Exactly! What’s fascinating is how both Gautam and DeLu, despite coming from very different industries and company sizes, share a common passion for intertwining employee experience (EX) and customer experience (CX) with marketing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMichelle Hawley:\u003c/strong\u003e Absolutely. It's really interesting to see how they both emphasize the importance of connecting these elements. So let's dive into some key takeaways from these interviews, highlighting their insights on EX and CX.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2\u003eTakeaway 1: Culture and Employee Experience\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDom Nicastro:\u003c/strong\u003e Let's start with Gautam. He really hit home the importance of culture in shaping both \u003ca rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://www.cmswire.com/customer-experience/teeing-up-employee-experience-to-enhance-customer-experience/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"employee and customer experiences\"\u003eemployee and customer experiences\u003c/a\u003e. Here’s what he had to say about focusing on employee experience first.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eGautam Pantakar:\u003c/strong\u003e\u0026nbsp;For me, it always starts with culture, you know. And I think what I would tell you is, have you ever, I don't know if I'm sure, you've gone out, but have you ever gone to this to say, you know, maybe, like a Walmart, you know, you look at the people that are working the registers, and they're all kind of like, maybe they're not really happy. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBut then you go into electronics, and man, they're that team is having the best time ever. Like they are gel, they are in unison. They love each other. They're having a great time. Then you go over to sporting goods, and you know, they're kind of all over. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSo for me, you take the cumulative group, everybody, golf, tennis, fitness, equestrian outfit, whatever it might be, and you say, I gotta figure out a way for this team to get the culture for the team the same. Because I can walk into one place and feel really good about the team. I can walk into another place and say, this is just a bunch of strangers.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSo what I did is we basically start with like a real Hey, the member experience is accumulation of everybody, right? It's the concierge, it's food and beverage, it's golf, it's everything that they do to the course today. So we've got to galvanize the team. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSo I start really quick with culture, right off the bat. And one of the things that we started is we started a plus one program, which is just a great, simple program, and it's nothing, it's no rocket science. But it's basically three parts. Number one is caught doing great program that we can award each other. If I see somebody walking in the rain to their house, I can jump in a golf cart, grab an umbrella and actually tell them, like, get in the car and I'll take you home, because it's a community, yeah, and I can award somebody a plus one for doing that. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eNow the members can also award the employees a plus one, because we can't see everything, right? A lot of things happen without anybody seeing. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe second part of that is what everybody has just an employee of the month. We've got an awesome TV screen down in the lobby where the person's face is on there, and there's a scrolling screen, and the last thing's like an employee of the year. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnd if you just start simple things like that, you start recognizing people, they're recognizing each other, then it's really about I want to achieve that, because I want the plus one pin that I can put on my shirt. You see, I have no plus ones yet because I haven't done anything awesome so far. You know, but it starts with culture. The ex side starts with the culture. There's no doubt about it.”\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMichelle Hawley:\u003c/strong\u003e That's a great point. Fostering a positive culture can have a huge impact on the overall experience. DeLu Jackson also spoke about the importance of culture in ADT’s operations.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDeLu Jackson:\u003c/strong\u003e\u0026nbsp;We have a team that's a collective team, cross functionally, that's dedicated to sharing that and communicating that and engaging with, again, all of our employees. And we share it at events and different activities. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAgain, many different touchpoints where we'll see it come to life. And the great thing is it's happening all the time. It's what we do, so it's always there, really always there. And people are just, this gives another opportunity and a platform for people to share that and collaborate on communicating it out.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRelated Article:\u0026nbsp;\u003ca rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://www.cmswire.com/customer-experience/is-your-culture-creating-a-great-customer-experience/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Is Your Culture Creating a Great Customer Experience?\"\u003eIs Your Culture Creating a Great Customer Experience?\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2\u003eTakeaway 2: Listening to Employees and Customers\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMichelle Hawley:\u003c/strong\u003e Listening is another crucial element both emphasized. DeLu talked about ADT's approach to actively engaging with their customers and employees to gather feedback.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDeLu Jackson:\u003c/strong\u003e\u0026nbsp;Yeah, I think, you know, the good news is we \u003ca rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://www.cmswire.com/customer-experience/mastering-customer-engagement-strategies-the-art-of-cultivating-brand-loyalty/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"engage with our customers\"\u003eengage with our customers\u003c/a\u003e. You know, we follow up with them through surveys and through feedback, through customer care. We take every bit of feedback very seriously. And as an organization, that's just a key part of us making sure we're providing what's important to them. And so that's really just what we continue to do. We have a team that's focused on that and again applaud them for always wanting to deliver an excellent customer experience.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDom Nicastro:\u003c/strong\u003e Gautam shared a similar sentiment about the importance of listening, especially in that hospitality industry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eGautam Pantakar:\u003c/strong\u003e\u0026nbsp;So I'll show you something. So we have this really cool Oldfield app, and it's very cool, and it's got a bunch of things in there. I mean, members can sign up for events on there. They can do it all. There's actually a section in there about, basically saying, you have something to say about an employee? Do have anything you want to say? \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnd in there also is an employee chat thing. Also, if you can't quantify it by dollars, but you can quantify it to culture, right? When you see an active chat room and you see people engage like, hey, it's somebody's birthday, and it's like 100 people writing in there saying, yes, birthday, happy birthday, blah, blah, blah. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBut we also do \u003ca rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://www.cmswire.com/customer-experience/4-internal-communication-strategy-tips-to-boost-teams-customer-experience/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"employee surveys\"\u003eemployee surveys\u003c/a\u003e. We still have that here. That's something that you need to have, but we actually have a member survey that ties back to the NPS, basically that \u003ca rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://www.cmswire.com/customer-experience/what-is-the-net-promoter-score/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Net Promoter Score\"\u003eNet Promoter Score\u003c/a\u003e. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSo we have those things. I'm not a huge net promoter score guy, because I think what happens with the net promoter scores? Nobody really ever gives it a gives it a barometer. Yeah, you know, you don't know if is it 10? Good? Who knows? Is it 20? Nobody ever knows, right?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSo then you Google, like, what is Apple's NPS? And you use that as a barometer. But I use the, what the survey for is really the the member feedback that we get. Yeah, member feedback is great because they do two things: they highlight the employees, and they tell you about their experience, and that's all the data I need. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe other thing we have not started yet, but we are going to start, is more of a in-the-moment kind of thing. So we have these cards that are going to be QR codes, so I can hand it to you. So if you came to dinner, I can just hand it to you, like Mr. Nicastro, how was your dinner last night? If you'll just take a quick picture of this QR code, we're going to ask you five simple questions. How was the food? How was the presentation? How did the server do? Is there anyone you want to highlight? Will you come back? Or something like that. So I get a lot of at-the-moment glances, and those are the metrics that we use now.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRelated Article: \u003ca rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://www.cmswire.com/customer-experience/harnessing-customer-and-employee-feedback-for-better-experiences/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Harnessing Customer and Employee Feedback for Better Experiences\"\u003eHarnessing Customer and Employee Feedback for Better Experiences\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2\u003eTakeaway 3: Connecting EX to CX\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDom Nicastro:\u003c/strong\u003e Connecting EX to CX is where the magic happens. Gautam elaborated on how a great employee experience can lead to a better customer experience.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eGautam Pantakar:\u003c/strong\u003e\u0026nbsp;So, something really small and kind of just silly altogether, but I mean, ultimately, you know, we spent money. Now, I know money is not the easiest thing to find, but if you can afford it, there's tangible things you can do, because you have to have some noticeable things that a customer will say, Oh, that's different from what it was last time.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSo we added something really simple. It was literally adding those nice, tall water, stainless steel water things to the dinner experience. So when the hostess comes over, the server comes over, they make great conversation, but they actually pour your water, which is a, which is a CX thing, but it was birthed out of an idea by an employee, because we made it such that ... you tell me what the customer wants, and they said, Hey, what's really cool is adding what table-side water service to them, and boom, so we we got the ex side because we heard them and implemented. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBut then the customer goes, that's really cool. And then what I can turn around and say is that ain't even my idea. That's so and so's idea. And then the applause for them is, I'm trying to push the applause to them constantly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMichelle Hawley:\u003c/strong\u003e DeLu also highlighted how ADT’s efforts to make sure employees understand their impact on customer safety plays a vital role.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDeLu Jackson:\u003c/strong\u003e\u0026nbsp;The Life Savers program. We did that for a number of years and continue to do that, which is essentially a program where when something unfortunate did occur, we had an opportunity for our monitoring teams that assisted in resolving those issues, meet with the homeowner and their families and the first responders, and just talk about all the important steps that occurred to make sure that everyone was safe. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWe did it in different geographies, in different circumstances, but there are these magic moments where we realize just how important the work is. And I love it that when our work and our purpose come together, that we make the world safer when we're doing our jobs well. And we have 13,500 associates that are just super passionate about making the world safer, and that's pretty amazing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2\u003eTakeaway 4: Innovation and Adaptation\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMichelle Hawley:\u003c/strong\u003e Innovation is key in both their strategies. DeLu spoke about how ADT has evolved to meet new safety needs with cutting-edge technology.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDeLu Jackson:\u003c/strong\u003e\u0026nbsp;Well, again, the evolution of the space and even what we've learned about all the different consumers, that safety means so much more to so many different people. As you said, sometimes it's video, sometimes it's response, sometimes it's what I see before things can occur, right, is preventative. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnd so as all of those things have occurred, it's given us a tremendous opportunity to expand our capabilities, but also the portfolio of offerings. So we have traditionally been known as a, you know, a professionally installed business and that's great. We take care of a lot of people. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnd then we saw an emergence of people doing self set up or DIY. We have an offering there. We have health opportunities for people because all of those things are part of the evolution of our safety journey. And so as our brand continues to expand those services and the technology capabilities, it's pretty exciting to be on the forefront of those innovations.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003eTakeaway 5: Emotional Connection for Powerful EX and CX\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDom Nicastro:\u003c/strong\u003e Emotional connections are powerful. Gautam’s story about empanadas really exemplified this.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eGautam Pantakar:\u003c/strong\u003e\u0026nbsp;So there's a young lady. Her name is Anna, and she works in the kitchen, um, she's one of the line cooks, you know, she does a lot of different, really, prep work. And so she came in one day and she made homemade empanadas. Mm, hmm. And there are two young ladies work back there, Anna and Eddie. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnd Anna comes in one day and she has leftover empanadas, literally leftover empanadas. And she goes up the chef and she's passing them out, you know, she's like, try this, try this, try this. Just no different than if I had a cookie at home and I had extras, whatever it might be. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnd the coolest thing about it was: A. they were delicious; B. She made them from home, brought it into us. He took those, and they are a menu item, and it says Anna and Eddie's empanadas. And we revealed the menu, and we did a bunch of different stations around there, and one of the stations was the empanadas. And guess who stood behind the empanadas? Anna and Eddie. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eNo patting me on the back, because this is Chef Jared's idea totally but he took the culture, he took the essence of what we're trying to do, and he says, \"Not only am I going to highlight you, but I'm going to stick you on the menu. I'm going to put you in front of all these people.\" They're super nice people, but I've never seen like, the pride in two people over something that little. And if we can do that, versus just simply saying empanadas, it became Anna and Eddie's empanadas.

Our team engaging with our consumers. We interact with thousands of people every day, right? Talking to them about what's most important to them. What we picked up from that was the tension between the fear that you talked about, but more importantly, the excitement people had about living their lives and the things they wanna do when that fear didn't exist. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSo we called it that tension between you only live once and FUD. And the insight for us was that what we really do is focus on what we protect people for rather than just what we protect them from. And that's a really great insight and creates a lot of excitement in the consumers because you can hear the excitement of the first home or my second home or one of my children is moving into a home and I'm providing this for them. It's just all this passion for doing amazing things. And if we take care of the other parts, let's celebrate what we protect you for.

It’s one thing to talk about humanizing marketing, but what does that look like in practice?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eKarna talks about just that, giving us an inside look at how that philosophy translates into day-to-day processes at Marqeta. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKarna Crawford:\u003c/strong\u003e\u0026nbsp;An example of this shift that we've been embarking on is a campaign that we have live right now that's called Grow Together. And in this campaign, we're tapping into an insight around how important and critical it is for growth and fintech companies to know that their partner is not only going to serve their needs today, but is actually going to be a thought partner and a leader that can help them grow to the next level.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMichelle: \u003c/strong\u003eBy focusing on growth and partnership, Marqeta aims to build deeper connections with its customers, which involves using insights from social listening and data analysis to understand customer needs and sentiments better.

You can’t escape it even if you try. So how do you make it work for you?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOur third takeaway is all about the balancing act between AI and maintaining that human touch. Karna talks about how she uses AI for her marketing efforts without losing the human element. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKarna Crawford: \u003c/strong\u003eI think the first thing is for us as marketers is not to think about these things as at odds with each other, technology versus humanity, and make sure the way that we are approaching technology is technology as an enabler of us bringing humanity into what we do..\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIf we use that as the starting place of our mentality, it allows us to make sure that the way we're leveraging that technology is through the lens of: How can it help me scale? How can it help me personalize? How can it help me measure whether or not I'm doing that effectively? As opposed to sitting behind the technology and letting technology be the face and the voice and make all of the decisions without any human touch to it.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhen you let that happen, and then when you don't have your team consciously always thinking about it through the lens of your customer as a human, how are you impacting a human? That's when technology becomes this benign thing and you lose that touch. But if the foundation of your marketing strategy and philosophy is customer first, customer sentiment, customer need, then technology becomes a tool to support that as opposed to the replacement of it, I think.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMichelle:\u003c/strong\u003e Karna’s point?

It has to be. But it can enhance marketing efforts while still ensuring the human element stays at the forefront.

And so I've spent a lot of time helping my team see how we should think about AI in marketing as our scaler.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWe have a small team. We invest in a very modest way and we have to make every dollar count out of it. So don't think of it as what it's going to do that you no longer will need to, and instead think of it as: How does it become my team? I only had headcount for one designer, for instance, but all of a sudden through this, that one designer might equal three or four. And so helping my team see it through that light of how it is their supporter as opposed to thinking of it as their competition.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMichelle:\u003c/strong\u003e Fear around AI, and \u003ca rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://www.cmswire.com/digital-experience/ai-in-the-workplace-jobs-creativity-ethics-at-stake/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"AI taking our jobs\"\u003eAI taking our jobs\u003c/a\u003e.

Instead, at Marqeta, Karna encourages her team to see AI as a tool that can enhance their efforts, capabilities and productivity. And those conversations, which should be ongoing to address concerns and talk about the benefits of AI, need to go hand-in-hand with a larger cultural shift within the organization. \u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003eTakeaway Number 5: Building Trust With In-House Media\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMichelle: \u003c/strong\u003eTom Wentworth from Recorded Future has some big ideas about marketing — and they might be a little different than what you’re used to hearing.

And we thought, well, why don't we sort of build our own news organization as a way to build trust with our audience? And if we did this, and if we're able to successfully do this, we can start really building a relationship that would be almost impossible for anyone else to replicate.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMichelle: \u003c/strong\u003eTom’s approach with their media company, Recorded Future News, has allowed his company to provide valuable, unbiased news, with almost no topics off-limits. The result? Trust and strong relationships with their audience. It’s an initiative that’s helped Recorded Future differentiate itself from competitors and position itself as a trusted authority in the cybersecurity industry.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eLet’s listen to Tom talk a little bit more about how this in-house media initiative started and the steps they took to build it from the ground up. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTom Wentworth: \u003c/strong\u003eSo the whole genesis of this was there's just so much happening in cyber and there are so many interesting stories that just weren't being told. So we said, why don't we just go out and hire our own reporters and go do this? And this wasn't ever meant to be a marketing investment. This organization we call Recorded Future News does report into me technically, but I don't think of them as marketers, we don't involve them in team meetings, like they don't think of themselves as marketers at all. They have their own separate entity actually, at Recorded Future.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMichelle: \u003c/strong\u003eMaintaining this journalistic integrity, keeping the news separate from the business, is what Tom credits to the organization’s success. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHe hired real, experienced reports and allowed them the freedom to cover relevant topics without marketing interference. And the result is a credible news organization that the company’s audience can turn to for relevant information they can trust. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eTom’s commitment to maintaining journalistic integrity within Recorded Future News has been key to its success. By hiring experienced reporters and allowing them the freedom to cover relevant topics without marketing interference, Recorded Future has built a credible news source that its audience trusts. And trust.\u0026nbsp; And that trust translates into a whole lot of benefits for the business side of the brand as well. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRelated Article: \u003ca rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://www.cmswire.com/customer-experience/customer-trust-the-backbone-of-digital-age/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Customer Trust: The Backbone of Digital Age\"\u003eCustomer Trust: The Backbone of Digital Age\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003eTakeaway Number 6: The Power of Long-Term Brand Building\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMichelle: \u003c/strong\u003eAnother big focus for Tom is the importance of balancing short-term marketing tactics with \u003ca rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://www.cmswire.com/digital-marketing/long-term-vs-short-term-marketing-whats-your-crisis-vision/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"long-term brand building\"\u003elong-term brand building\u003c/a\u003e. He even gave us some insight into his past mistakes and the lessons he learned from focusing too much on short-term gains. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTom Wentworth:\u003c/strong\u003e\u0026nbsp;So I worked with a company called Acquia, in the CMO role, about 10 years ago. And love Acquia to death, great experience. I made the tragic mistake of just only committing to hitting the number in the short terms. Every quarter, me and our head of sales would sit down and we would, you know, wonder why we weren't hitting our numbers or why we weren't growing faster.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSo I spent all my time and all my budget doing things that would help us hit the number this quarter. I didn't think for a moment about, well, how do I build a better brand for Acquia? How do I think about getting Acquia in front of the kind of people who think about Adobe? Our biggest competitor was Adobe. Everybody knows Adobe. No one, relatively speaking, knew about Acquia. And I never spent a minute thinking about how to solve that problem.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHad I spent time thinking about how to do something there, I think Acquia would have gone public and would have been maybe, you know, even bigger than they are now. And it was the biggest mistake I've made in my career by far.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMichelle: \u003c/strong\u003eTom’s point? CMOs need to invest time and resources into long-term strategies that build a sustainable brand — rather than over-focusing on getting those immediate results. So how does he do that at Recorded Future? \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTom Wentworth:\u003c/strong\u003e\u0026nbsp;I think about two-thirds of my time should be spent thinking about how I'm going to help this company hit our quarter, hit our number this quarter and maybe next quarter, in 2024. But about a third of my time is spent thinking about what are things I can do in marketing that are going to have an unfair advantage over multiple years. It takes a lot of discipline to do that.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMichelle: \u003c/strong\u003eTom’s approach involves spending a big portion of his time on strategies that will provide long-term benefits, even if they don’t show immediate or even easily measurable results. But ultimately, this kind of long-term perspective is what you need to build a strong, sustainable brand. \u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003eTakeaway Number 7: How to Leverage Podcasts for Brand Engagement\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMichelle:\u003c/strong\u003e In addition to its news site, Recorded Future has also ventured into the podcast space. Tom talks about moving away from the norm with its narrative-style podcast and how it complements their overall media strategy and further engages their audience. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTom Wentworth: \u003c/strong\u003eWe decided to build sort of a narrative documentary style podcast. And to do that is hard because you have to have a showrunner, you have to write a script, you have to set up interviews, you have to do a different level of production on it. So in order for us to do this, we went on and hired a real legit podcaster. We went on and hired Dina Temple-Raston, who was a very well-known podcaster on NPR. She has a voice like an angel. Not only is she a brilliant storyteller, but she just sounds like a podcaster. It's incredible how good she is.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnd we gave Dina a production team. She brought over some of her team from NPR and we now have built, so we call this podcast Click Here. And it isn't just this interview every week. It's these real cool stories. Like Dina, her team flew into Ukraine right after the war and sat down on the ground level to figure out what's happening and did some incredible reporting.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMichelle:\u003c/strong\u003e And Tom’s commitment to high-quality production — and a little bit of risk-taking — paid off, with their podcast achieving some significant success and recognition in the tech news category. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTom Wentworth:\u003c/strong\u003e\u0026nbsp;Now this podcast has become, we're in the tech news category. And it's essentially every week like Bloomberg, Wall Street Journal, Recorded Future.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWe're in the top 10 of this tech news category and getting over a million downloads a year at this point and growing. It's been an incredible success.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMichelle: \u003c/strong\u003eWith this investment in high-quality content that resonates with their audience, Recorded Future not only has another avenue to engage their audience, but it also reinforces the brand’s credibility, authority and trust in the cybersecurity space. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRelated Article: \u003ca rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://www.cmswire.com/customer-experience/seamless-omnichannel-strategy-best-practices-for-customer-engagement/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Seamless Omnichannel Strategy: Best Practices for Customer Engagement\"\u003eSeamless Omnichannel Strategy: Best Practices for Customer Engagement\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003eTakeaway Number 8: Finding White Space in the Marketing World\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMichelle: \u003c/strong\u003eWhat does that mean exactly? According to Tom, it’s identifying those opportunities that other marketers are missing out on and committing to them for the long-term. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTom Wentworth:\u003c/strong\u003e\u0026nbsp;I think in some ways, marketing is like this game of arbitrage where you're always trying to find the white space to go where no one else is, but the natural tendency is just to follow the crowd.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eLike my competitor is on TikTok, so I should be on TikTok. If you do that, you're going to fail without a doubt. Don't do that. So I think the first thing is to start to find things that you can do uniquely and own and commit to over a long period of time. Because if you go do that thing for three months, it's going to fail. If we had looked at the Record, our news site after three months, we would have cut it. It would have had 10,000 views a month. Terrible, right? We just hadn't built an audience yet. It took us a year to really start to see the results of building an audience.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMichelle: \u003c/strong\u003eIt’s all about being unique, taking risks and sticking with it. And here we go back to those short-term vs. long-term marketing tactics. You can’t pick an objective and stick with it for a couple of months and then throw in the towel if you’re not seeing instant results. Sometimes, big successes require big time investments. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eTom even offers up a suggestion for where he’s seeing a lot of white space right now — YouTube for B2B. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTom Wentworth: \u003c/strong\u003eI think YouTube for B2B has this massive white space. What's great about YouTube is the algorithm prioritizes stuff you like. So if YouTube knows you like B2B and you're a B2B publisher putting content out on YouTube, I think the algorithm could direct a ton of content to you.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMichelle: \u003c/strong\u003eOwning the white space is hard. But as Tom has shown us, if you stick with it, it can pay off big time. \u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003eThat’s All We Have for Today… \u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMichelle: \u003c/strong\u003eWe’ve covered some amazing insights from Karna and Tom — two very different yet successful paths in marketing. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThese different paths show that there’s no one-size-fits-all approach in the world of marketing.

Raj discusses how these models enable more natural communication with systems, allowing contact centers to harness corporate knowledge effectively and streamline processes for improved outcomes.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRaj Krishnan:\u003c/strong\u003e\u0026nbsp;So you know, one of the big opportunities that we have with the large language models, you know, we like I was just reading a report this morning, right? All these web self-service bots, were kind of picking up. I think what these new large language models have dramatically changed is the ease with which now people can actually interact with systems.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnd to me, that's the biggest benefit, right? So we're, for example, when we used to build a customer service bot, we had to use these natural language models to say what is the intent, what are the different utterances? How, like say I want to book a ticket and how in 10 different ways can I say so that I teach the language model to understand what we say. What has dramatically changed is that I just simply talk the way I talk, and the system understands it. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThat's the power of the large language model, right?\u0026nbsp;\nHowever, the biggest limitation with that, along with it, comes these large language models are trained with a corpus of data, and to grounded to what is relevant to your data. like, for example, if I'm a customer service person with my own data, how do I leverage this ability of these language models to understand what I'm saying, but use my data to be able to respond?\u0026nbsp;\nSo those are the areas where I see tremendous opportunity. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhy is it important? One of the big challenges is these contact center representatives, you know, they all come in with different varying skill sets. Somebody has deep skills about your domain, some of them are new. To me, what the AI is going to do is just set that level so that everybody can leverage corporate knowledge, and then interact with it very easily. I think a lot of the projects that I'm working on are more not about just using AI, but taking a business process and infusing AI everywhere possible to simplify and improve the outcome.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRelated Article: \u003ca rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://www.cmswire.com/contact-center/ais-transformative-role-in-customer-support-and-service/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"AI's Transformative Role in Customer Support and Service\"\u003eAI's Transformative Role in Customer Support and Service\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003eMeeting Customer Expectations: The Evolving Role of the Contact Center\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDom:\u003c/strong\u003e Our second takeaway, Sean discusses how modern contact centers are grappling with rising customer expectations, where knowing a customer’s journey before they even reach out is no longer just a bonus, but a necessity.\n\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSean Albertson:\u003c/strong\u003e\u0026nbsp;Well, being that, you’re the second, third, or fourth, or fifth step that the client has taken, you know, ultimately in the contact center, we're already behind the eight ball in the consumer's mind, in the customer’s mind. You know, we of course don't know what they've tried necessarily and where they've been and how long they've already been working on it. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe reality is though, from that seamless experience the customer expects, they expect us to know in many ways what they've done and the effort they've already put into resolving their issue. So by the time they talk to someone, they're usually at a level now of, well, I've done everything I know to do in an easy way, and now I've got to talk to you. And so that puts extra pressure. Going back to your point, when the call center was the first stop, there wasn't that much expectation.\u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBut now there's kind of this expectation. You should know what I've already tried to do. And God forbid you should know if I tried to call you before, and this is my second or third call about a subject. And so we're already kind of starting off behind where the customer's expectations are in the contact center. And we have to think differently and ultimately act differently to really prepare ourselves for that new expectation.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRelated Article: \u003ca rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://www.cmswire.com/customer-experience/four-steps-to-shore-up-your-cx-and-meet-customer-expectations/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"4 Steps to Shore up Your CX and Meet Customer Expectations\"\u003e4 Steps to Shore up Your CX and Meet Customer Expectations\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003ePrioritizing Customer Service Excellence Over Cost Savings with AI Integration\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDom:\u0026nbsp;\u003c/strong\u003eNow we’re talking about the shift from cost-cutting to customer service excellence and leveraging AI to provide timely, accurate information that not only enhances the customer experience but also leads to natural cost savings by streamlining processes and reducing resolution times, and Raj drives that home here.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRaj Krishnan:\u003c/strong\u003e\u0026nbsp;To me, I think the cost savings should not be the goal, right? The goal should be, hey, the way that I serve the customer and want to serve them faster, I won't serve them with the deep knowledge of what I have in my doing this for over a year, over years. And then how do we use all that and provide the best customer service experience within a short period of time? This is automatically going to result in cost savings, right? It's not about how can we get rid of five people using AI. That's a very wrong approach to AI right? \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe thing is looking for processes where AI can Oh, like one of the things that I mentioned, is this, right? like, I'm just working for the same company. And one of the things they do is they go and, like, create a knowledge repository by looking at your websites and create a, what we call a vector database for retrieval argument generation.\u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSo that when a question is asked, it goes and finds the answer, instead of somebody having to go copy and paste and then craft the response for you. To me, what it does is provide accurate results very quickly, and then you're addressing the customers’ issues and reducing the time. That's how we should look at it.

There was a lot of digital transformation exercises and a lot of companies were making those improvements. I mean, we've been doing that steadily in the early 2000s and through, but man, COVID just put it in high gear. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnd all of a sudden everything, you know, if they weren't, if a company wasn't thinking about going digital first, they were during COVID because that was the only way obviously that we, that they as an organization could survive. And so it's just put that much more pressure on the environment. Now the value to the consumer is they've gotten a lot more options. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnd now with, of course, the apps and the websites and chatbots, I mean, digital now has become the starting point for every interaction. And the challenge for most of us that have grown up in the contact center is now we're at, as you mentioned earlier, kind of that second seat. We come in after usually the initial work online has. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnd it's been an interesting migration, but that acceleration of that digital transformation, digital first activity, it's really put us in a position where we have to think differently about our role.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eRelated Article: \u003ca rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://www.cmswire.com/customer-experience/transforming-your-digital-customer-experience-with-ai/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Transforming Your Digital Customer Experience With AI\"\u003eTransforming Your Digital Customer Experience With AI\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\n\n\n\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003eIntegrating IVR and CRM for Enhanced Customer Experience\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDom:\u003c/strong\u003e Sean discusses advancements in IVR technology are revolutionizing customer service. He gets into how the seamless integration of phone systems with CRM allows companies to personalize interactions and streamline the customer journey from initial contact to human support.”\n\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSean Albertson:\n\u003c/strong\u003eWell, yeah, I mean, think about the IVR, the phone tree and phone system, you know, from touch tone in the past and now talking to it. Well, at that point, you know, they know which number you've called in on, you know, using your Annie or your actual phone number to find you, assuming you're calling on the number that which nowadays everybody calls from their cell phone because nobody really has home phones anymore. So, yeah, they know who you are. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThat integration then allows, you know, the IVR and that upfront system to kind of look into the CRM. And say, all right, I know this customer. I know their account. I know all sorts of good information about them. And that is being used and has been used then to present to the agent to say, hey, here's who's calling. But it's a tunnel, if you will, data upfront from an offline or a non-human interaction to then presenting to that human interaction within that integration. And that's the key behind it, for sure.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003eEnhancing Self-Service: Addressing Frustrations with Proactive Solutions\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDom:\u0026nbsp;\u003c/strong\u003eNow, we’re discussing the challenges and opportunities in self-service technology. We'll explore how improving self-service systems to recognize customer intent and seamlessly escalate to human agents when needed can transform customer interactions from frustrating to fulfilling.\u003cp\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eRaj Krishnan:\u003c/strong\u003e\u0026nbsp;Yeah. So when we say self service, the biggest challenge we have had is that people like to start with our IVR, a bot, right, two or three interactions, you just want to shut that thing and just go talk to a human being because of the poor experience that we have. To me, this is where like we should be able to identify the things that people would emit. like, let's say, I want to get the status of an order, you know, I certainly don't want to talk to a person, I wish I could just go to the system and say, Hey, I'm the customer. And then it automatically uses my voice to verify who I am, and once it knows who I am. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnd it goes and pulls my orders and tells me Hey, I know what you're calling about because there's an outstanding order, here is the status of that to meet that self service. Right? So service is not a customer asking other questions, getting frustrated, not getting what they want to be proactive and using that, to me, those are the candidates concerns of it. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHowever, there may be certain scenarios where I ask a couple of times the system doesn't respond, automatically escalate to a live agent, bring all the context and then tell the live agent, hey, this person is almost losing their patience. They've tried AI, but now let's let the human in. So kind of blending that based on the context is what we need.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRelated Article: \u003ca rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://www.cmswire.com/customer-experience/customer-support-definition-importance-5-essential-strategies/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Customer Support: Definition, Importance \u0026amp;amp; 5 Essential Strategies\"\u003eCustomer Support: Definition, Importance \u0026amp; 5 Essential Strategies\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\n\n\n\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003eAI and Forecasting: Revolutionizing Predictive Analytics in Customer Service\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDom:\u0026nbsp;\u003c/strong\u003eAI is transforming the landscape of predictive analytics in customer service. Raj’s explores the shift from traditional data modeling to advanced AI-driven forecasting, and how this technology is not only enhancing accuracy but also providing real-time insights to optimize contact center operations.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRaj Krishnan:\u003c/strong\u003e\u0026nbsp;I mean, so you know, the like, actually, that's a more of an established machine learning area, right? But surprisingly, I'm seeing more and more, the AI is almost taking over everything, right? I used to think that if I needed to do a forecast, I needed to get historical data, and then feed it and all that. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBut now I just saw the other day, where you tell the thing, hey, can you just predict the, you know, sale of appliances for the next four years. And you're asking a ChatGPT, or this thing, this thing is able to actually come without me providing some of these things, looking at patterns and the existing data, whatever it has, and be able to actually create that Arriba model, the forecasting model, right. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSo AI is almost creeping in into more of this. But I still believe that traditional forecasting, having the right input data, modeling it and knowing the variables, that the whole hyper parameter, the tuning the model, that is still an area that, you know, it requires a bit of a machine learning capabilities. To me, the contact center is one of the major, major things, right, in terms of predicting your load, how many agents should I have? \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnd what times and what like, you know, there was a project that I did I remember, we were just trying to predict the inflow of customers into a fast food restaurant, there are so many things that goes into it, one of the things we did was a real time camera, watching the inflow of vans, right to say, on an average, four people in the van, now I started five in the van coming and I'm seeing a trend go because there's an event. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eNow that's a real time impact. So when you talk about particular call centers, right, something is happening, there is a, you get a lot of, so modeling and all that it will always remain a complex thing. So you're going to need some solid machine learning capabilities and scientists, data scientists to do those types of things.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDom:\u003c/strong\u003e Sean highlights the importance of integrating predictive analytics into customer service strategies:\n\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSean Albertson:\u003c/strong\u003e\u0026nbsp;Yeah, absolutely. And that is, you know, that's a key, right? And, you know, again, predictive analytics isn't new either, but fundamentally it's, it's getting easier because a lot of us are putting our data in the cloud. Our data is now more joined. We can start to use it in that way. And so, yeah, using as an example. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSo what my rocks program, for instance, does, it basically looks at all of the relevant data associated with experience, you know, call center metrics, operational metrics, survey results and survey metrics. It looks at text analytics and journey analytics, the stitching together of the actual physical journey of the customer. And it uses AI to predict high effort, low effort across those scenarios. So think of it this way, you can look at, for instance, your call transcripts and tie that to this post-call survey, because again, we all know. customers don't leave, most customers don't leave comments and most of the comments we get are kind of useless. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBut you merge together and use AI to study it, you can now look at the call transcript and say, what out of the calls is predicting high effort or lack of loyalty or sentiment or things of that nature? And then that predictive analytics, you train your models on the past data and now you can predict the same metrics, survey metrics if you wish on all the transactions that never took a survey.\u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eYou literally can look across all your transactions and predict what their experience would have been or what their score would have been. And now you take proactive action to go after those clients and say, hey, we noticed this was occurring or even better, some of the tools and some of the vendors out there are getting even faster where you can almost do it in real time and you can interrupt the bad journey. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnd try to redirect it in a positive way. And so those tools are becoming even more and more available using AI and using the power of data analytics, bringing those things together.\u0026nbsp;\nAnd certain activities and certain metrics will predict certain results better. That's part of the predictive analytics you run. I mentioned earlier, lack of resolution, the No. 1 predictor of high effort. Not the only, but the No. 1, the highest correlation between lack of resolution and high effort.\"\n\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDom: \u003c/strong\u003eThat wraps up our key takeaways for today.

This interview was part of our \u003ca title=\"CMSWire TV series\" href=\"https://www.cmswire.com/tag/cmswiretv/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"\u003eCMSWire TV series\u003c/a\u003e show, \u003ca title=\"The Digital Experience\" href=\"https://www.cmswire.com/tag/the-digital-experience/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"\u003eThe Digital Experience\u003c/a\u003e. We have many programs within that CMSWire TV series, and we hope you check it out. My particular show is The Digital Experience, and I was honored to catch up with Shelby, who shared a \u003ca title=\"remarkable story of personal dedication and professional expertise\" href=\"https://www.cmswire.com/digital-experience/empowering-accessibility-discovers-story-of-inclusivity-in-the-digital-age/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"\u003eremarkable story of personal dedication and professional expertise\u003c/a\u003e in the critical field of digital accessibility.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI pulled out five key takeaways from my interview with Shelby, highlighting her commitment and the incredible work she's doing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFirst, though, I wanted to note that this topic is super timely for May 2024. It's always timely, right? Because we need to build these digitally inclusive experiences. But May 16 was \u003ca title=\"Global Accessibility Awareness Day\" href=\"https://hub.wpi.edu/news/1214/global-accessibility-awareness-day-2024\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"\u003eGlobal Accessibility Awareness Day\u003c/a\u003e, recognized by an organization called the WPI Hub. We're having a very timely conversation here, folks. That organization noted that 1 billion people worldwide have disabilities.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eForrester researchers checked in with CMSWire a while ago and noted that only 39% of businesses in North America indicated accessibility is a formal requirement on projects, and a mere 29% gather feedback from people with disabilities on their projects. We need to do better.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe good news is that there are people like Shelby Mitchell out there leading the way and doing better every day. So let's get into our takeaways from the Digital Experience show on CMSWire TV with Shelby Mitchell of Discover.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eTakeaway 1: Personal Commitment to Accessibility\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDom:\u003c/strong\u003e My first takeaway is Shelby's deep personal commitment to accessibility. Her journey is driven by personal experience that fueled her passion for creating inclusive digital spaces. Her personal story is truly inspiring. Her commitment to accessibility isn't just professional, it's deeply personal. You'll find out why in a sec. This dedication is evident when she talks about her son and how his experiences have shaped her professional path.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eShelby:\u003c/strong\u003e I have a child with disabilities. He's seven years old, and he had a stroke in utero. So he has cerebral palsy, epilepsy, and something called apraxia of speech. He has many diagnoses, and we're still very early in his journey with disabilities. I really wanted to figure out a way to merge my \u003ca title=\"customer experience and marketing experience\" href=\"https://www.cmswire.com/customer-experience/the-intersections-between-marketing-and-customer-experience/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"\u003ecustomer experience and marketing experience\u003c/a\u003e with digital experience and my personal life. So I started getting into universal design, inclusive design, and digital accessibility during COVID, when we weren't driving around and were all in lockdown. That's when I started digging in deep. Ultimately, I put together a proposal to make it a unique function within Discover.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt became its own function, and now we have a small team. It's really exciting to see how things have grown and evolved and the excitement within Discover around the work we're doing. My son is pre-verbal; he could still develop speech, like what we're doing now. But in the meantime, he leverages a communication device. It has pictures and words, and he taps on them to put together short phrases and sentences. So, when he's old enough to open a credit card or checking account, what will that digital experience look like for him? Will he be able to engage with a website or mobile app as they are currently designed? If he needs customer support, will he be able to communicate what he needs or where he's struggling? And will the agent be able to communicate back?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRight now, we're focused on making our website and mobile app accessible, but other teams are also doing a lot of work.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRelated Article: \u003ca title=\"Empowering Accessibility: Discover's Story of Inclusivity in the Digital Age\" href=\"https://www.cmswire.com/digital-experience/empowering-accessibility-discovers-story-of-inclusivity-in-the-digital-age/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"\u003eEmpowering Accessibility: Discover's Story of Inclusivity in the Digital Age\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eTakeaway 2: Building an Inclusive Culture at Discover\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDom:\u003c/strong\u003e Shelby's personal experience is incredible and touching. My second takeaway is about how Discover has built a culture that prioritizes accessibility, doing better than the majority, according to Forrester Research. This isn't just about compliance; it's about creating genuinely\u0026nbsp;\u003ca title=\" inclusive experiences\" href=\"https://www.cmswire.com/customer-experience/5-ways-diversity-and-inclusion-impact-the-customer-experience/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"\u003einclusive experiences\u003c/a\u003e. Shelby talks about how Discover’s culture supports and promotes accessibility from the top down. This kind of environment is essential for making real progress in digital accessibility.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eShelby: \u003c/strong\u003eDiscover has a culture of putting the customer first and enabling our customers to have brighter financial futures. Our culture is already in the right place; broadening that view to include accessibility ties in well with our existing culture. Culture is a huge part of making gains in accessibility. We've had meetings with our executive team to share the work we're doing, and they're very supportive. Many leaders within our organization are also supportive because of the culture that attracted them to Discover. When you don't have a personal connection to disability, it can be challenging to understand how big the population is and the types of disabilities people have.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eTakeaway 3: Collaborative Efforts Across Teams\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDom:\u003c/strong\u003e Accessibility, like most corporate initiatives, must start at the top. That support is critical. My third takeaway is about collaborative efforts across teams. At Discover, accessibility is truly a team effort. Making digital spaces accessible requires a collaborative approach, and many people are involved. Shelby emphasizes how different teams work together to ensure accessibility is built into every project.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eShelby:\u003c/strong\u003e We work and consult with our development teams, design teams, and design system and common component teams. Digital accessibility is a multi-touchpoint approach. If you don't have an accessible design, developers can't create an accessible experience. It starts with design and research. When we're developing concepts for a digital experience, whether for a website or mobile app, we ensure we're pulling in individuals with various disabilities to understand what works and what doesn't and adjust the design and development accordingly. We also have our universal design advisory board at Discover, which includes employees with disabilities, parents, family members, and friends of individuals with disabilities. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe board provides a gut check to teams before they do more fleshed-out usability or consumer insights testing. The advisory board leverages their personal experiences to provide feedback on what works well and what doesn't, suggesting adjustments in colors, content, and other elements. The board started by recruiting people from our employee resource groups, and our projects have grown over the years.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRelated Article: \u003ca rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://www.cmswire.com/digital-experience/4-principles-for-accessible-web-design-digital-experiences/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"4 Principles for Accessible Web Design \u0026amp;amp; Digital Experiences\"\u003e4 Principles for Accessible Web Design \u0026amp; Digital Experiences\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eTakeaway 4: Putting Feedback Into Action\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDom:\u003c/strong\u003e That board is a powerful way to hear directly from the affected community, those with disabilities. Crafting\u0026nbsp; requires this kind of input from the target audience. As an editor, finding content that resonates with specific people in specific roles with specific challenges is crucial. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe fourth takeaway is about how Discover conducted early research with users with vision disabilities on one project and learned that its initial assumptions were incorrect. This highlights the necessity of direct feedback from the target audience. This insight not only improves the physical product design but also expands into creating more accessible digital solutions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eShelby:\u003c/strong\u003e We were researching the best physical product for users with vision disabilities. We had a hypothesis, shared it with users, and they said it didn't work for them. Because we did this research at the very beginning, we learned a lot. This is a perfect case study of why you have to ask people with disabilities what works and what doesn't, because your assumptions could be totally wrong. Ours were. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe research evolved the conversation. We leveraged existing products to categorize them differently, making it easier for users to find what they need. This expanded to how we convey that in the digital space. The digital aspect is still in progress, but it's exciting to see that work spark other conversations.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRelated Article: \u003ca rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://www.cmswire.com/digital-experience/why-web-accessibility-is-crucial-for-brand-customer-experience/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Why Web Accessibility Is Crucial for Brand Customer Experience\"\u003eWhy Web Accessibility Is Crucial for Brand Customer Experience\u003c/a\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eTakeaway 5: Vision for the Future of Accessibility\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDom\u003c/strong\u003e: It's incredible to see all that research feedback and iterations on creating these experiences. It's a listen, learn, adapt, and create model, constantly evolving based on feedback. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eMy fifth and final takeaway is about Shelby's vision for the future of accessibility at Discover. She talks about the ongoing efforts and future goals to enhance digital inclusion. Her passion for continuous improvement in accessibility is evident. She shares her plans for the future and the importance of building robust design systems and expanding research projects.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eShelby:\u003c/strong\u003e We are just getting started, even though we've been on this journey for 10, 15, or 20 years. The most important thing is ensuring our design systems are set up to create accessible components, the building blocks, so that our design and development teams have a good starting point. Having that built out into a strong library is essential. Another big focus is continuing to build the number of research projects with our consumer insights team, involving individuals with disabilities. Listening to research and understanding how someone leverages their technology is powerful. Until people see and experience through observation where someone is struggling or succeeding, it's hard to grasp. Seeing that makes a light bulb go off, and it's like, \"Oh, now I get it.\" Those are the two biggest things we're focusing on this year, though there are many more.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDom:\u003c/strong\u003e So there you have it. Five key takeaways from my conversation with Shelby Mitchell on the CMSWire TV series, The Digital Experience. Her personal passion and professional dedication to digital accessibility are super inspiring. Discover is fortunate to have such a committed advocate leading their efforts.

I started off really helping organizations make their products, you know, better, faster, easier to use, specifically software products, digital products. And then over the years, I started to expand partnerships across the organization, as opposed to just digital partners.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo you know, marketing and sales and service and whatnot. And that led me to expand my career insights, so to speak, into making the business, you know, easier to use, as opposed to just the products. So as opposed to only look at digital maturity, I now start to start to look at broader cross channel maturity.

Talk to our listeners about that distinction between UX design and experience design. Are you saying experience design is different from a general like UX person?\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKaran 3:32:\u003c/strong\u003e Yeah, it's a good question. I wouldn't necessarily say it's different. User experience design; it's still experience, right? It's just that the term UX has a very strong connotation to digital. When you say that you're working on \u003ca title=\"UX design\" href=\"https://www.cmswire.com/customer-experience/what-is-user-experience-ux-design/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"\u003eUX design\u003c/a\u003e, more often than not, the person on the receiving end is thinking, OK, so phone app, mobile app, web app, is it a digital platform? Is it a website, whatnot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd the term experience design, in its origins, we can say, captured the general essence of \u003ca title=\"human centered design\" href=\"https://www.cmswire.com/customer-experience/improving-customer-experience-with-human-centric-design/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"\u003ehuman centered design\u003c/a\u003e, not just digital user experiences, I think the term UX just stuck for like 20 years now. Because when it started to get adopted, we were on a very high trajectory of these startups and companies, early 2000s, where UX was just everything. But then over the years experienced design has become more and more clearer, where concepts like service design have started to become clarified to say, well, we're not talking about digital channels, we're talking about physical channels, channels, where we have, for example, our physical stores and the staff and their interactions with customers, and how they use our digital tools; not just what the digital tools are that customers use. So it's the connectivity between all of those channels that I think is just considered as experienced design.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRelated Article: \u003ca title=\"Why Human-Centered AI Is a Winning Strategy\" href=\"https://www.cmswire.com/customer-experience/why-human-centered-ai-is-a-winning-strategy/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"\u003eWhy Human-Centered AI Is a Winning Strategy\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eOptimizing Customer Journeys in Finance\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDom 4:59:\u003c/strong\u003e Yeah. Awesome, well, thanks for level setting, they're super helpful. I think now let's get into like the meat and potatoes of what's keeping you busy lately. And I know you're passionate about leading journey management and service design efforts. And, you know, can you share kind of an overview of that, and, you know, how journey management and service design efforts kind of contributes to kind of enhancing that financial wellness, right, and those journeys of your customers and prospects with insurance and investment products?\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKaran 5:32:\u003c/strong\u003e So it's a pretty wide ranging topic. When we say journey management or any service design, even the very terms themselves service design, journey management, there's, there's a lot of overlap. In fact, the term service design hasn't been as widely adopted here in the US, you know, it's very largely adopted out in the European markets, or even the Canadian market. But this concept of journey management service design, in general, I'll just talk about all of it together.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd, you know, my particular role within NM or even in the industry in general is, how do we look at the different experiences or the interactions that consumers are having with us, throughout their entire lifecycle with us from when they are a prospect to if and when they become a customer? If and when they decide to promote us or buy more from us? What are all of those inflection points, you could say, or individual experiences, or journeys, and all those different points of your relationship between the customer and the company, identifying those in a way that is very data backed?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat are the priorities for the customer? And where do we focus most effectively? In recent years, where have we developed the most strength to respond in a very competitive and also a very capable manner in the market? By collaborating with a variety of different teams—like research content, data science, and specific subject matter experts from business functions—all these elements come together to actually define the primary journeys we should target. In my role, I begin to help create that language, putting some of that language on paper within the organization, either with specific business functions or on specific projects.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen, I zoom out of that language to say, \"Now that we've identified one, two, or three priority journeys, let's go through the ABC process, steps, methods, and whatnot, also in a very cross-functional way, to identify our strengths and then build a point of view in both a strategic and a tactical capacity.\" This enables us to say, \"We are going to do A, B, and C things.\" But then here's the way in which we're going to measure those things, as opposed to just talking about it at a very high level. So, that's, you know, not in a nutshell, what journey management entails and where I spend most of my time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eCrafting a Unified Customer Language\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDom\u0026nbsp;7:57:\u003c/strong\u003e Yeah, well, that's a lot of time there. I mean, if you're looking at the lifetime journey of the customer, that's a lot of data, a lot of interactions, a lot of sentiment, you know. How do you, as a professional, work with different teams to truly collect this data and make it actionable? Is it like one platform that you're using, or is it a bunch of disparate data that you have to make sense of together? How do you analyze all of those touchpoints?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKaran 8:34:\u003c/strong\u003e Basically, you're getting at the meat of the problem, really. Because, ultimately, there are camps about this in the community. In that sense, should we be looking at boiling the ocean, at least to some degree? Or should we really only take bite-sized chunks out of it? Generally, when we look at the entire lifecycle of the consumer, as I mentioned, you know, we think of it in terms of what happens when somebody is just becoming a customer from being a prospect, what happens when they've already become a customer, and what happens when they are looking to just stay as a customer, and you're looking to retain them, and whatnot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd across all three of those segments, you can say, or high-level chapters of that lifecycle, you have a lot of different touchpoints, a lot of different types of journeys. So how I've gone about it, and how, as a team, we're also doing it, and then as well as how we did it at my previous company, is that we're redefining that language for what those journeys and experiences are across the board. And again, there are some industry best practices about it as well, which we can unpack a little bit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut once we define a language around it, it does two things. One, it brings all these cross-functional partners a little closer to the conversation because we might have CX talking about something as a \u003ca title=\"customer journey\" href=\"https://www.cmswire.com/customer-experience/surviving-the-journey-of-customer-journey-mapping/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"\u003ecustomer journey\u003c/a\u003e, but then we might have UX design talking about something as a UX flow. They're both talking about the same thing but at different touchpoints. So having a language like that on paper demystifies this ocean that you're talking about, which is a lot of data, a lot of different touchpoints. And it allows a strategist like myself to then start the conversation around our trade-offs and our choices: What are we going to focus on, and what are we not going to focus on, because it's just not realistic to do all of it in one shot. And in really large companies, again, like NM, there's a lot of attention to a lot of things at the same time, as you would expect.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere are so many priorities, a lot of momentum behind our competitive response, behind our continuous day-to-day operation. So taking teams away from that day-to-day operation and executional focus and getting them to think about change in any capacity is a challenge in and of itself. So that's where this idea of breaking down the lifecycle of the whole consumer experience into smaller chunks helps serve as a very tangible output of CX, a very tangible output that you can really point to and say, \"These are our athletes, or our catalog of all the different journeys, or our taxonomy of all the different journeys.\" And eventually, again, the dream being that we may use some platforms, or may use some sort of manual effort to layer in insights from data science, from finance, and legal, to user experience research, to broad market research, and several other sources.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRelated Article: \u003ca title=\"How AI Is Revolutionizing the Customer Journey in 2024\" href=\"https://www.cmswire.com/customer-experience/how-ai-is-revolutionizing-the-customer-journey-in-2024/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"\u003eHow AI Is Revolutionizing the Customer Journey in 2024\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eData-Driven Customer Improvements\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDom 11:40:\u003c/strong\u003e You know, that's awesome. To get that soup to nuts kind of data view, it's so hard, it's so challenging. And I think a lot of people would be like, \"Yeah, I get that. It's not easy.\" Can you think of an example where you used a big data set to improve a certain part of the customer experience, like something you did recently you're proud of, or even one customer who got a better experience because you had data, you had the experience you wanted in mind, and you executed it? Is there something particular that you could point to in that regard?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKaran 12:21: \u003c/strong\u003eYeah, you know, fortunately, I've been able to be part of teams and projects where we've gone from strategic envisioning all the way to tactical measurement of that strategy. Some very recent examples I've been part of here at NM, where we started to look at direct impact to consumers, or even just direct impact to teams that are working on that area.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe were talking about this idea of consumer lifecycle earlier, a key component of that lifecycle is how consumers find customer service, how they engage the organization by calling, or by looking at a mobile app, or by sending an email, or in some cases, just sending a \u003ca title=\"chat message on the website\" href=\"https://www.cmswire.com/digital-experience/why-conversational-ai-is-so-much-more-than-a-chatbot/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"\u003echat message on the website\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd NM has an increasingly strong presence across a variety of different channels. And over the last few years that I've been here, last year particularly, we spent a good amount of time really diving deeper into some very specific customer journeys within the servicing space. And again, we didn't solve everything, but we started to identify some priority areas where we can say, \"What are the blockers for consumers to access our digital platform? Are there some very immediate low-hanging fruit where we can improve the accessibility for that? Or we can improve the way in which they register for our digital accounts, for example? Or what are the ways in which our home office teams or our customer service department essentially, how are they adopting different shortcuts in terms of change management processes in terms of just manual procedures? How can we, again, enable them with perhaps some additional tools, or by reducing some of the complexity on our internal digital platforms?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe start to look at a lot of those areas of the broader customer service function, so to speak, and the journeys as part of that, and as a result of that diagnosis, we had identified some very specific actions that were then put into a roadmap later in the year, actually, that essentially help, again, increase the speed in which consumers can access and NM's website, or the ease in which our home office teams are able to identify data.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd some of those actions are active experiments that we're seeing through into this year now. And then some of those are just additional questions that we're going to start to explore further to say, \"Well, in general, we haven't solved customer service, we're going to continuously improve on it. So how can we keep going?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd by taking a very cross-functional approach throughout their engagement, if you will, it wasn't so much about this idea of handoff or recipient and find a strategy. And now we pass it on. And then someone on their team is figuring out the execution, rather it became a question of just transitioning, you know, the way in which we're measuring that strategy or the way in which we're defining some goals around it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo that's just one very recent example. And then, prior to that, as well, in different capacities, even at a previous company, I was looking at, you know, along with the team, how do we improve not just the digital maturity of our experience, but also the physical experiences that we have, such as meeting with a financial advisor at their office? What is that experience like? What is that meeting in conversation like, you know, meeting with these advisors, often at community industry events, and whatnot? So again, there are a lot of different ways in which not just NM or like other players, but many, many other community members or strategists in a mechanic capacity actively seek out impact. Yeah.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eTracking the Physical Customer Experience\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDom 16:02:\u003c/strong\u003e So now you're getting into the \u003ca title=\"phygital world\" href=\"https://www.cmswire.com/customer-experience/phygital-a-confusing-neologism-for-a-very-real-problem/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"\u003ephygital world\u003c/a\u003e, right, like physical and digital. I'd love to ask you a follow-up on that. Because you know, that physical interaction is just as important as the digital for some people. In fact, I mean, there are people starting in digital, and then they go to physical, and they just want to get it accomplished. They want the same experience, they want to be in and out quick, with transparency.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow, my question to you is, is there a way to track that anecdotal data of the physical experience? How do you collect that one-to-one informational session with a financial advisor or insurance adjuster and a customer? Like when they're sitting down at a desk? Like, do you have to, you know, interview the rep from your team? Or how does that work? In terms of collecting that information?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKaran 16:54:\u003c/strong\u003e Yeah, that's a great question. You know, particularly, it reminds me of some very recent conversations over the last year, in fact. So there's this idea within our community that is increasingly talked about, it's called co-creation. The term co-creation, you know, by definition, is that you're problem-solving together.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd in the example you're specifically talking about the advisors, and like, the reps and whatnot, you know, we've at NM, at least, we very heavily lean into that by inviting the advisors and their staff, because often they're running independent practices of their own, you know, by inviting them into a joint dialogue with us in our human-centered problem-solving processes and, and methods and whatnot, and often with cross-functional leaders and tactical teams at NM as part of that conversation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo the question doesn't necessarily always stop at, \"But how are we going to capture the anecdotal data?\" But often the question becomes more about for advisors, \"What do you think, you know, we're not necessarily always going to have some sort of digital listening post and add into every single dialogue. It's just not practical, right?\" But in lieu of that, how can we build these partnerships with these advisors who are actually in many ways, the face of the brand, right?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey are the, you know, they are the owners of the relationship, you could say, right, because they nurture these relationships with consumers, even outside of NM, it this is a pretty common practice within the insurance industry in general. So large matrix insurance companies particularly benefit from treating the advisors as that thought partner as that, that listening post, so to speak. And as part of that dialogue, again, it becomes a question of disseminating their feedback, which is often coming from, you know, strong focus on, say, certain types of customers, because you might have three or four really loud customers and a long tail of maybe not loud customers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd some advisors are very, very specific and very prescriptive, and what they're seeing, while some advisors may be very focused on, again, what they're hearing from those, you know, those select few customers. So having that variety of, you know, feedback, as part of those conversations that we can have, as part of any journey really can help identify, you know, more nuanced feedback.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRelated Article: \u003ca title=\"Get Phygital and Tone Your Customer Experience\" href=\"https://www.cmswire.com/customer-experience/get-phygital-and-tone-your-customer-experience/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"\u003eGet Phygital and Tone Your Customer Experience\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eThe Golden Ticket of Customer Insights\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDom 19:23:\u003c/strong\u003e Yeah, that to me is like, that's the golden ticket, right, right there to get insights of an actual customer experience. Like, I know, you know, we get all excited in our world of the digital customer experience. And that's so important, I mean, incredibly important. But to have that one to one, you know, adviser talking to a customer in a chair in front of them, and to take those insights and bring it back to the digital team.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBecause I'm sure you I'm assuming you you collect this probably customers that come in and say the mobile app's not working I tried to Get this done on the website and I, and I couldn't, that's why I'm here. So you might get some digital feedback from those in person interactions, I'm assuming you do we do.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKaran 20:12:\u003c/strong\u003e Our mobile or our, our digital footprint in general, for consumers, or mobile app or website, they do have increasingly, you know, increasingly sophisticated, you know, ways to capture like nuanced feedback, whether it's, you know, very specific tracking on what areas of the product are used most and which ones are not, or just tracking on, you know, overall session times, and, you know, and whatnot, from the advisors lens, there's also this other aspect to think about digital maturity. But for the advisors, you know, the whole world of \u003ca title=\"digital customer experience\" href=\"https://www.cmswire.com/customer-experience/current-state-of-digital-customer-experience-in-2024/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"\u003edigital customer experience\u003c/a\u003e, or digital CX, right?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYes, it has the end customer in mind. But we can also think of it just as any consumer, which means our home office teams, our, our financial advisors, even me as an employee who's trying to use three of our internal platforms, that employee experience is an equal part of broad customer experience, umbrella. That's where the term experience management comes in, right, where we think of employee experience, customer experience, brand, experience everything all together.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo when we talk with all these advisors about the feedback, often that feedback is coupled with feedback about the digital platforms that advisors themselves use that, like, you know, what would be better if I were enabled with X, Y, and Z data points when I'm talking with this consumer in my office, and you guys should do better and provide a, b and c for that. Now, that's a pretty actionable piece of feedback for us to then dive deeper into.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDom\u0026nbsp;21:47: \u003c/strong\u003eThe employee experience. You mentioned it jibes with everything we're hearing from CX leaders like you. And I think it's just like you said, I think it's gonna just meld into experience, there's not going to be any customer experience anymore. It's not going to be employee experience anymore enough, it's going to be one experience one umbrella.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd we're actually seeing titles that reflect this, we're seeing \u003ca title=\"head of EX and CX\" href=\"https://www.cmswire.com/podcasts/cx-decoded/strategic-alignment-for-cx-and-ex/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"\u003ehead of EX and CX\u003c/a\u003e, right. So if I asked you like in 1985, like, who owns employee experience, you'd probably say, What do you mean, the HR people? You know, they signed me up, they pay my checks, you know, that if I have a benefits question I go to completely do game now. So my question to you is in Northwestern, like, who would you say, you know, owns employee experience? It sounds like a complete group effort?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eCross-Functional Roles of CX\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKaran 22:38: \u003c/strong\u003eYes, that's the short answer. Yeah, I don't think and this is actually just my personal belief, I don't think CX is something that is owned by an individual role or individual business function, I think what is owned, is, you know, the, the accountability or the responsibility to be that force multiplier to be that tailwind of the rest of the business, you know, so that you can unify and unite everyone toward a common goal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd it's definitely a tough job. But when we say own your own goals is, you know, that you have the accountability to execute on it, or, you know, in other words, where you're controlling the, you know, the, the delivery of it, and it's just in business, you know, we have a variety of different functions that own the delivery.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd, of course, a lot of the problem solving for different pieces. We have, you know, individual business functions, again, like marketing, like distribution, like, you know, customer service, we have, in many companies, individual functions for product for engineering, for design, it's only in recent years, or I guess, over the last decade now, where we see the CX function start to absorb digital partners, like product management and design, it wasn't the case like 10 years ago, I don't think and as part of that this conversation of ownership is shifting, in the sense that teams are owning bits and pieces of the execution, but then certain teams are, you know, owning the, you know, the, the broader effort, which is more about influencing and more about, you know, guiding the conversation with a lot more of that cross functional dialogue.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRelated Article: \u003ca title=\"Guide for Perfect Sales and Marketing Alignment\" href=\"https://www.cmswire.com/digital-marketing/guide-for-perfect-sales-and-marketing-alignment/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"\u003eGuide for Perfect Sales and Marketing Alignment\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDom 24:22:\u003c/strong\u003e 100%.

And you're like, Well, this has to go through a few hoops, right? So like, who are the who's you know what, let me ask you this way. Who's your best friend in that company? Right, who's that person that in another department cross cross departmental friend, best friend BFF. That you feel that as it's so important for you to to connect, you know, day to day, week to week go and just kind of like hash it out and try to get these better experiences for customers. Yeah.

And those partners could be having a variety of titles, you know, you could be in UX research, or you could be in data science, or you could be within consumer marketing and insights. But you know, any role or any team that has, you know, greater access than me, to what's happening with the consumer sentiment, what's happening with the business performance, and access to that kind of data and access to those perspectives, that I've found to be incredibly helpful, not necessarily only on projects, but even in general in how how I personally think about challenges, you know, it's improved my own critical thinking to be honest. So, within NM, particularly, as you can imagine, we have all these teams, they're all in different parts of the company, and they're all doing a lot of different things at the same time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd I get to work with all of them, often in different capacities. So that's why it's a fun job, right. But when it comes to the involvement of them, that's where the challenge can can start to become very clear that sometimes you can bring everybody at the table all at the same time. Sometimes you have to bring one party at the table, knowing that here's the trade off, you know, we need to park a, b and c things so that eventually some other team will give us feedback.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo that's a muscle that I think any CX function just gets better and better at over time. Or even any individual like role like a strategist like myself, right. But this idea of having, you know, as you will put it, like best friends across the board, I think that idea is very true, if we really think about the brass tacks of you know, what makes a really strong CX like function, you need to have friends across the company, you need to have these, these levels of appreciation on how different partners can come together, as opposed to this idea that we're gonna do A, B and C, we'll hand it off, and then they'll worry about whatever the next thing is.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDoing the latter, it's inevitable in some cases, because of just the pace of things or because of, say, funding models. But when you can, when we have the right leadership support, and when we have the right organizational design, to actually have these cross functional partnerships. The result is striking, it's very effective, because you just get a lot more diversity in the perspectives that you present. Yeah,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDom 27:48: \u003c/strong\u003eYeah, you're almost kind of like having to sell within your own company, like, you know, partner with me on this, I'm telling you, we all our data is telling us this is the way to go, you know, mobile app, we need to optimize that right now, we need to do more. So you almost got to sell yourself to these other leaders in these other departments.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKaran 28:08:\u003c/strong\u003e Oh, definitely. And, you know, I, you know, it's well put, in fact, you know, because, and I even when I'm talking with, with folks within experience, design, whether it's product design service design, or I'm talking with folks in CX, you know, this idea of being able to pitch the value of our perspective or selling it, I think that idea tends to not get as much attention as it perhaps needs to, because, you know, by definition, I think we need to, you know, bring folks along, we need to, you know, demonstrate that, like strategy as an example, or customer experience strategy, it's not so much about an individual isolated effort, you know, we can co create it. And when we co created the outputs, we'll have a lot more fingerprints from the whole organization. And because it's going to have a lot more fingerprints from everybody, it's going to have a lot more buy in. And because it's gonna have a lot more buy in, it's going to have a lot of momentum when it comes to execution. Yeah.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eExploring the AI Landscape\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDom 29:04:\u003c/strong\u003e Karan, we've been talking for like about 30 minutes. And guess what we haven't mentioned yet?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKaran\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e29:12: \u003c/strong\u003eOh, I think I know; AI.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDom 29:14: \u003c/strong\u003eWe haven't mentioned AI. I've talked to a lot of folks lately, especially if I went to the Adobe Summit recently, and there was a lot of on the ground marketers, you know, talking about \u003ca title=\"where they are with AI\" href=\"https://www.cmswire.com/digital-marketing/beyond-hype-practical-applications-and-limits-of-generative-ai-in-marketing/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"\u003ewhere they are with AI\u003c/a\u003e. So for me, the vision and the aspirations on the keynote stages were very different from the ground. People on the ground, and that's usually the case, right? Because the keynotes are awesome. They've been planning it for six months. And they look awesome. And I don't deny that there's great technology behind this.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut my question to you, but what I've discovered was, they're not. They're still exploring. They're a little scared. There was another financial services leader there. and they were not diving in at all because of the compliance issue. So, question is to you, where have you made some gains with AI? Where are you overall? Since chat GPT, and generative AI came in the conversation? How much has it changed? If anything, for you kind of wish you had out there?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKaran\u0026nbsp;30:20: \u003c/strong\u003eYeah. Well, how many times this conversation comes up? All the time, right. So let me put it this way. AI is something that I'll talk about, like my perspective on it, and then I'll talk a little bit about, you know, how we're talking about it. And then, so when it comes to AI, I'd say we're studying it, you know, we're in process of interviewing it, you know, so to speak, you know, what I'm seeing is that when it comes to AI tech, because currently there are a lot of it is driven by, you know, new emerging capabilities that are not necessarily in a proven business models or anything yet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo when I think of those capabilities, I think of it in context of just how we think of, you know, our capabilities as people, you know, think about hard skills, think about soft skills. And what I'm seeing is that AI tech, in general, it's, it leans very heavily on hard skills. And that's probably expected, right, because it's very driven by like, transactional, like technology first. And what I mean by hard skills, specifically is where again, the example of ChatGPT.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd since then, over the last year, year and a half, now, we've seen a lot more momentum, with tools, these value propositions that are cropping up across the board, as you know, startups, some of them very compelling as well. And they're tools that essentially help intake a lot of often very unstructured data, do a lot of clever things with that data, analyze it, and then spit out outputs that could be in the form of some text output. That could be in the form of some some audio video, you know, we're seeing some pretty compelling things there. Right. But it's essentially input and output. In other words, we can think of it as a tool to boost our productivity.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd when I say our productivity, I mean, again, think of \u003ca title=\"ChatGPT\" href=\"https://www.cmswire.com/digital-experience/chatgpt-what-you-need-to-know/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"\u003eChatGPT\u003c/a\u003e. You know, it helps you think a little differently, it helps you question ideas a little bit, and clarify assumptions a little bit based on you know, our prompts. On the other hand, when I think of soft skills, the picture changes very heavily. It's not so much about tactical tools, it's more about, you know, negotiating between stakeholders, you know, aligning stakeholders that are very often having, you know, different priorities, or in some cases, competing priorities, with strong opinions in bringing teams along in this cross functional way, where you're talking about demonstrating to demonstrating outputs, that will get toward one goal, as opposed to individual outputs that teams typically produce, you know, that type of conversation, that type of navigating across the organization. It involves a much broader and much more nuanced understanding of what how business works, how communication works.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd I don't think AI tech is anywhere near that level of sophistication when it comes to just, you know, the soft skills. So the hard skills rolling great, you know, definitely piqued interest piqued everyone's interest. Well, you know, as I said, we're studying it. So we're actively exploring, how can this be used to enable our employees with maybe some more productivity tools? How can this be used to maybe enable our financial advisors or maybe some consumer efforts?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd that question is, it's an ongoing question, right, as opposed to rolling out some big bang value proposition in the market. It's more so about trying different things and testing them with smaller segments, and then increasingly with larger sample sizes. And the more we do it, I think, the more it will become clearer on if there is opportunity for AI to also jump into, you know, the broader discourse of communication within the business, or is it just one more tool in our toolkit?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRelated Article: \u003ca title=\"ChatGPT Is All the Rage but Don't Stop Learning Just Yet\" href=\"https://www.cmswire.com/digital-experience/chatgpt-is-all-the-rage-but-dont-stop-learning-just-yet/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"\u003eChatGPT Is All the Rage but Don't Stop Learning Just Yet\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDom 34:12:\u003c/strong\u003e Yeah, so sounds like a little smattering, like a sprinkle of AI here they are test here test. So exploratory would be would that be accurate for where your teams are at right now?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKaran 34:24:\u003c/strong\u003e Yeah, definitely. I think that's actually true. In general for for the whole financial services industry. Yeah.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDom 34:31:\u003c/strong\u003e Yeah. I mean, I was asking that practitioner I was talking to at that conference a few weeks ago, like, yeah, you're not just gonna throw in a bunch of financial data into ChatGPT you know, like, here's all our customers information now. Give us some trends. Like hello, can't do it. Compliance. We get it. This has been a super great conversation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eBridging Audiences in Customer Experience\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKaran 34:57:\u003c/strong\u003e One big takeaway. Oh, It's always like this, like picking a favorite. Anything, right? There's so many things that come to mind, though, you, you're talking about two different audiences for the most part, you know, one is the broader customer experience audience. And the other is a little bit nuanced audience, which is experienced design and how it fits within customer experience.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI have, fortunately been in the middle of both of them over the whole course of my career, when I think of the next year or so, there are a couple of things in terms of just standout trends, that, you know, I would call out for both of these communities and, you know, ideally brush them in when it comes to customer experience, there is increasingly over the past many years a lot of dialogue around uniting action from the executive level, all the way down to tactical level, and, you know, introducing more and more customer advocacy within the org. So if you're working on broader CX efforts, you know, consider how you can make those efforts measurable, how you can make those efforts very bite sized.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo again, that's for some of the examples we talked about, such as defining, you know, a language around your journeys comes in, as opposed to trying to solve for, you know, the whole experience or the whole journey at the same time. I think that can be very effective as a very specific practice with a lot of cross functional participation. And it can also help CX teams in general, but a lot of credibility within the company.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDom 36:33:\u003c/strong\u003e\u0026nbsp;Karan, thank you for all these insights. today.

And yeah, I'm excited to have my first article published with you.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eOverview of LinkedIn's Customer Experience Team\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDom Nicastro 1:19:\u003c/strong\u003e All right, well, let's give our listeners the lay of the land here for you, Sam and your team kind of the structure, you know, the dynamics of that CX team that you're in, where you fit in who your team is, and kind of what are the main objectives there?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSam Stern 1:34:\u003c/strong\u003e Yeah, sure. So I've been at LinkedIn on the customer experience team for close to three years now. And our customer experience team is really focused on \u003ca rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://www.cmswire.com/customer-experience/what-is-customer-experience-design-benefits-best-practices/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"experience design\"\u003eexperience design\u003c/a\u003e. So we do journey mapping, qualitative research. We have a bunch of techniques we use to prioritize and set up for execution with some of our cross functional colleagues, changes to the experience based on what we learned in our research and our journey mapping.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd with the experience insights team who are colleagues of ours in sort of the same larger organization, but on a different team. They have all the customer data, they're doing surveys and collecting other forms of feedback, where they're soliciting feedback from customers.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut then they also have inbound data and operational data.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo social media comments, I mean, we are a social media platform. So it was a comment on the platform on LinkedIn, support tickets, data from our platform, so from usage, page times and those types of things.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd so we're using all of that data, one as inputs to our experience, design work and our journey mapping. But even further back, we're using it to help us determine where we should be working, what projects we should be doing next, what parts of the experience, need our focus, so that we can take effort out for customers take effort out for employees.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRelated Article: \u003ca rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://www.cmswire.com/customer-experience/what-do-customer-experience-teams-actually-look-like/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"What Do Customer Experience Teams Actually Look Like?\"\u003eWhat Do Customer Experience Teams Actually Look Like?\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eKey Performance Indicators (KPIs) for Customer Experience\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDom Nicastro 2:48:\u003c/strong\u003e What are some of those big top level KPIs amongst that data? You know, what are the top few that you're really looking at day to day? You're thinking about it when you're not working? Like those KPIs that kind of like, okay, we gotta get this number up, or we gotta have this number, do this, this number, do that? Are there a few of those that stand out? Yes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSam Stern 3:08:\u0026nbsp;\u003c/strong\u003eSo first and foremost, trust, the emotion of trust is something that we take very seriously, we track and measure, trust is not much evidence for the big social media platforms, except it is for LinkedIn. So it's really down to LinkedIn, and Pinterest that are the two social media platforms that people trust these days. And we take that very seriously that responsibility to maintain that trust. So trust is something that we're tracking, as well as perceived value. So our customers feel like they're getting value for money for their services that they're spending, and then also ease of doing business. So are we taking effort out of the process? Are we automating things that can be automated or removing steps that don't need to be taken by customers or by employees? So those, I would say, would be the three big ones: trust perceived value and effort?\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eThe Distinction Between Customers and Members at LinkedIn\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDom Nicastro 3:54:\u003c/strong\u003e One point you mentioned to me in our pre talks was the difference between customers and members. I think this conversation, people would love to know the difference in how you guys view those, it's two different buckets, right?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSam Stern 4:07:\u0026nbsp;\u003c/strong\u003eSo it's interesting, because it's every customer, I think I can say this, every customer is a member. But if you think about your relationship with LinkedIn, you're probably thinking about a member relationship. If you're listening to this podcast episode, you're a member of LinkedIn. And that's who we honor first, because the ability of members to get value to find interesting opportunities, whether it's jobs, whether it's people to work with, whether it's content that's going to help them be better in their role that keeps them coming back to the platform that gets them to trust us and see value from us. And it's that engagement that makes LinkedIn an appealing platform to customers. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnd so then many of those members not all of course, because we have 1 billion plus members, but many of those members become customers when they need to hire someone when they want their Salesforce to better target by using Sales Navigator when they want to buy learning products, all the different doughnuts we have. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSo we're trying to balance the needs of both right? We want the customers to get value from the ads that they place on LinkedIn or find great candidates for their jobs. But equally on the other side, we want members to feel like they're getting great jobs because what we always say is we're trying to unlock economic opportunity for everyone. And so in both directions, we want to create that mutually beneficial marketplace and platform.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eStrategies for Managing and Utilizing Customer Feedback\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDom Nicastro 5:23: \u003c/strong\u003eAnd those members are very chatty on LinkedIn. I know if people make comments, they make statements. It's emotional, please. I mean, it is just a forum for world dialogue, really just have what's on your mind professionally. What's on your mind personally, sometimes, I like the touch when a lot of people go personal. I'm like, I didn't know that about this person. You know, the question I'm getting at for a CX person on LinkedIn, a CX manager, like yourself, what do you do with that massive amount of material? Right? There's so many posts, so many comments, so many replies, so many groups, private groups, public groups, webinars, LinkedIn live, people are saying things every second on LinkedIn. So how does the CX team gather all those insights? And what do you do with them? It's\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSam Stern 6:16: \u003c/strong\u003eAn incredible amount of data, as you said, being generated. So a lot of times we're looking at trends, and we're looking at responses in activity and behavior on the platform to changes that we make, for example, when we implemented \u003ca rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://www.cmswire.com/digital-experience/6-ways-generative-ai-is-changing-content-management/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"AI generated key takeaways\"\u003eAI generated key takeaways\u003c/a\u003e from articles or from newsletters, we want to see how many people are using that are more people reading the articles that are they engaging with the content more? \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSo a lot of times it's about because it's such an overwhelming amount of information, as you said, it's about using that information to focus ourselves on reviewing tests are changes that we've made using the data and focusing on a specific area, because if you're trying to look at it all at once, it's obviously overwhelming. If you're using it to make a decision about whether a new feature you implemented was successful or not. It's much easier in that case, right? Because you have great data coming in and you've focused on a very specific, narrow, tailored question to answer with that data.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDom Nicastro 7:10:\u0026nbsp;\u003c/strong\u003eShould I put my link in the post Sam, or in the comments? That's a big debate, right? This is totally off subject in a bit. I'm just, I was just thinking of it, right? Because we post all the time on LinkedIn. And it's a big part of our business, social media strategy, and not just like, hey, hey, that guy's doing it differently. How do I do it?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSam Stern 7:28:\u0026nbsp;\u003c/strong\u003eI know, I think actually put it in the comments. Okay. Yeah. Because I think it formats strangely in post. I don't know why we haven't made that easier. But yeah, usually, what you'll see a lot is people write the post, and then, you know, point you to the first comment, usually from themselves, of course, for the post to the podcast, or the article, you know, on another site, or wherever it is. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eIntegrating Employee Experience (EX) with Customer Experience (CX)\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDom Nicastro 7:52: \u003c/strong\u003eLet's talk about that \u003ca rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://www.cmswire.com/customer-experience/why-organizations-benefit-by-embracing-cx-and-ex-synergy/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"EX and CX dynamic\"\u003eEX and CX dynamic\u003c/a\u003e that you alluded to quickly. I know it's a big deal for you. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSam Stern 8:12:\u0026nbsp;\u003c/strong\u003eYeah, that's right. So when I was at Forrester, I did a lot of research, I was on the customer experience research team. But I did a lot of research on employee experience, and customer centric culture, and how both of those support delivering a great customer experience. And with LinkedIn, integrating that employee experience with customer experience, our last podcast, guests had a great example of like, their NPS was low, if a call center call went more than like 15 minutes, right? And a manager would come on at that point, and would remind the agent about, hey, this is the time to maybe shift pivot, what can I do to help kind of thing? And that was a great example to me of using \u003ca rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://www.cmswire.com/customer-experience/cx-and-ex-great-cx-improves-employee-experience-too/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"CX insights to fuel EX\"\u003eCX insights to fuel EX\u003c/a\u003e. Because now the agent is having a better experience. Maybe the call goes better, and maybe they get better grades after, right? What are some examples there for your team, the infusion of EX with CX and kind of how you're looking at that.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRelated Article: \u003ca rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://www.cmswire.com/customer-experience/is-it-time-to-make-cx-and-ex-one-experience/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Is It Time to Make CX and EX 'One Experience'?\"\u003eIs It Time to Make CX and EX 'One Experience'?\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSam Stern 9:05: \u003c/strong\u003eFor us. It's interesting, so much of our customers' interactions with us are digital on the platform with our tools and services. But we have large Salesforce, large customer success teams, we have customer support. And all of those customer facing roles and teams, they're there for really important moments of the experience, the account setup, or the walking you through how to use a new product, or when you have an issue and an error, and you get to global support. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSo we think of that interplay, as the platform should work, the product should work, but when they don't, the humans, the people, the employees stand behind that and make sure that we back that up. And I think again, to me, that's part of the equation of trust, it should work and if it doesn't, we stand behind that to fix it to make it work. We back up our experience. And we want to make sure that those employees are equipped to deliver a great experience in those moments because those moments will be really important. and really memorable to customers if they go well, or if they do not go well. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnd so that means giving them access to data and knowledge about the customers, and the context and where they were before they got to that point, and the experience and the feedback, there's a tool we use to sort of let sales reps and Customer Success reps record, and then listen back to their calls and sort of use that as training to get better on their customer calls. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnd all of that is designed to sort of help those \u003ca href=\"https://www.cmswire.com/customer-experience/fusing-voice-of-the-customer-and-voice-of-the-employee/\" target=\"_self\" title=\"https://www.cmswire.com/customer-experience/fusing-voice-of-the-customer-and-voice-of-the-employee/\"\u003ecustomer-facing employees\u003c/a\u003e get better and better at nailing those key moments in the experience, because we know that the human delivered moments in an experience are more memorable, either good or bad. We're human, we're used to sort of interacting with people. So we're social beings, we remember that kind of stuff. So those moments are few and far between, as they are still really impactful because they live long in the customer's memory.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003eBalancing Employee Experience With Customer Insights\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDom Nicastro 10:50:\u0026nbsp;\u003c/strong\u003eYeah, and that experience insight team, the one that collects the data, your teams and any other team really around the CX effort at LinkedIn, are there KPIs that they have for the employees, like, you know, sometimes there's employee Net Promoter Score, right, or employee effort score, whatever you call it? Are you looking at some employee data alongside your customer data? \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSam Stern 11:13:\u0026nbsp;\u003c/strong\u003eSo we have ease of doing business with LinkedIn, which is about making it easier for customers to work with us. And we also have ease of doing business at LinkedIn. And that's for employees. And my team has done some research with our customer-facing employees. And it's clear to us that there's a lot of effort we can take out of their daily work. And it's daily work that is preventing them from doing their more important daily work, namely, being on calls with customers. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSo as much as we can do to remove some of that effort to track activities, or to keep their book of business updated, or whatever it is, we can make that easier or automate parts of that, then we're freeing up hours for them to spend more time preparing for client meetings on client meetings. And that's high value, high productivity time for customer facing employees. So that's a big metric for us, as we think about the employee experience is, do they feel like it's easy to work at LinkedIn and get their jobs done and deliver value to our customers?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDom Nicastro 12:12:\u0026nbsp;\u003c/strong\u003eYeah, like, is there an actual, like, scientific model for that? Or is it a lot of anecdotal data? It's a lot of spreadsheets, like the ease of doing business. Is it actually, is there a formula behind that?\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSam Stern 12:23:\u0026nbsp;\u003c/strong\u003eThat's a good question. So it is a little bit of a mix, we are doing sort of, we're asking them to give us time estimates for how much time they're spending on things. But then we're tracking some of that, and some of the systems how much time they're spending doing certain tasks. And we've done some time diary studies. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSo we are trying to collect some of that data directly. But also, the actual amount of time it takes is important, and it's great to have, but how they perceive that time is really important. If it feels like it's taking a long time. And it feels onerous, even if it's not, that's valuable information, because we know they're really feeling like, you know, maybe it only took them five or 10 minutes, but they just thought it was painful. And it took way longer than it should. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnd that's going to impact them, that's going to sort of bring them down a little bit. They're not going to have the same sort of sunny effect when they're talking to our customers later. So we want to manage that as well, their perception of how much effort or how much time things take.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRelated Article: \u003ca rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://www.cmswire.com/customer-experience/the-art-of-balancing-employee-experience-and-customer-experience/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"The Art of Balancing Employee Experience and Customer Experience\"\u003eThe Art of Balancing Employee Experience and Customer Experience\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDom Nicastro 13:34:\u003c/strong\u003e Those CX leaders (at a Forrester event in 2022) were talking about agent experience more than anything, when I was talking to them at the lunch tables in the hallways and what have you. And on stage, I was fascinated by that. I'm like, wow, we really are moving towards an EXE type of CX dynamic here that has to be baked in. What have you learned lately, from all these insights with the ease of doing business at LinkedIn? What are some big top level concerns of these customer facing employees? And what have you done on the back end to kind of address these challenges?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSam Stern 14:07:\u0026nbsp;\u003c/strong\u003eYeah, we have learned that employees want to feel and want to believe that they are critical to have some part of the experience that what they do matters. And that is seen that that is respected right, in an organization like LinkedIn, where it's mostly digital, you could see how maybe they would think what they did wasn't valued as much as you know, the platform activity. And so they want to know that we understand we, the rest of the organization understand the critical role they're playing in our experience. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnd as you were just alluding to \u003ca rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://www.cmswire.com/customer-experience/a-4-step-recipe-for-improving-your-contact-center-agent-experience/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"agent experience\"\u003eagent experience\u003c/a\u003e, you know, the concept of that moment of service recovery when something did go wrong. There's many, many instances where that saves the relationship. They're heroes. It's a you know, it's like a game saving diving catch in the outfield. So it's on that level. That's really important. And what they also want to feel is that they are empowered to deliver that experience. So do they have the information they need? \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eDo they have the permission to spend the time needed with that customer to give them the experience they need. And then enabled to do they have the data they need, do they have the tools? Do they have the training so that when they're in these interactions with customers, they feel like they are set up for success. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThose are feelings that when they feel enabled, when they feel seen when they feel empowered to do what's necessary to deliver the right experience for customers, that has been sort of a really sturdy equation that lasts, right that when you set up employees with those beliefs, and those success factors, they will mostly almost always deliver a really good experience to customers. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSo that's what we've been focused on is getting them to that feeling where the data they have worked for them and are at their fingertips to tell them about the customer, and where they feel like they can take a few extra minutes with that customer if they need to. Because we're tracking performance. But we also have some leeway in that if they find a customer needs a little extra attention. Those types of things make them feel empowered, right?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRelated Article: \u003ca rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://www.cmswire.com/contact-center/the-importance-of-contact-center-agent-well-being/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"The Importance of Contact Center Agent Well-Being\"\u003eThe Importance of Contact Center Agent Well-Being\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDom Nicastro 15:59:\u003c/strong\u003e I've had 25-minute awesome conversations with call center agents, you know, where, I like to talk. So sometimes it makes me feel good on the day when someone listens to me, right? It just goes beyond that duration, right?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSam Stern 16:22:\u0026nbsp;\u003c/strong\u003e100%. And just to your example, that agent using their judgment and their skills to assess that, hey, I've got Dom on the phone, and he wants to chat, I'm going to stay on with him, right, versus someone else. It's like this person's in a hurry, might hear the kids in the background, I'm going to process this as quickly as possible. Again, that's a sense of empowerment that we trust the agents to read and react with what the customer is looking for in that moment, right and adjust the experience and service they deliver accordingly. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDom Nicastro 16:50: \u003c/strong\u003eOne thing I think that companies want to get better at CX team, CX leaders is taking the feedback from the agent and using it effectively. Because how do you capture that? I don't want to say water cooler, everyone says that I hate that when any of us even talk over water cooler, when the agents are talking to each other after work, or they have a smoke break or something like that. A zoom break, if you will, if they're remote, right? How do you capture those moments? Right? I mean, where they're talking about customers, how they solve the problem. The agents have a wealth of data and anecdotes that can fuel better customer experiences. So is there a strategy there with collecting agent feedback \u003ca rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://www.cmswire.com/contact-center/the-power-of-the-super-agent-the-key-to-customer-satisfaction/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"agent experience\"\u003eagent experience\u003c/a\u003e?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSam Stern 17:33:\u003c/strong\u003e Yeah, so one of the things that we do, and totally share that perspective that we are always trying to get more of that information. To me, it's sort of thinking about, like, there are things they know, and they've known them so long, or they've adapted so well to work around or adjusting to whatever their constraints are in their the employee experience for the experience they have to deliver, that they might not even be able to tell you about them if you just ask. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSo we'd like to get them to show us. So we'll use a technique called contextual inquiry where we'll sort of ride along with them and have them share their screen and show us the different steps. They're going through the different systems, they have to click through to complete something. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnd it's hilarious to me, because first of all, they have like 30 tabs open, and they're clicking around. And then they'll say, oh, and I see this data point, that means I'm gonna have to go to this other system and grab this piece of information. It's like, well, how do you know that? Like? Well, I've been here for three years. So I just figured that out. At some point, we note that down because it's like, no new employee is going to be able to do that on day one. And so now we have a training opportunity, or we have a process thing that we want to fix, right? Because it's like, as soon as someone tells us they figure that out, or someone else told them, but it's not the prescribed way of doing things. That's a moment for us to go and try and fix.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRelated Article: \u003ca rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://www.cmswire.com/contact-center/ai-in-contact-centers-championing-your-agents/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"AI in Contact Centers: Championing Your Agents\"\u003eAI in Contact Centers: Championing Your Agents\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDom Nicastro 18:46:\u003c/strong\u003e And I think that's the moment where you realize that we just have to do it like Undercover Boss, does it? Does she ever. Yeah, just go. It's like a verb for me: go undercove-boss-it, right? Yeah, go sit in their shoes. Watch how they do it. So that's like the reverse effect that's starting with employee experience, to fuel customer experience, because if that first week, employee, first day employee is going to benefit from your efforts of seeing what's wrong with the three year employee, and in turn, probably going to help the customer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSam Stern 19:17:\u0026nbsp;\u003c/strong\u003eAbsolutely. And actually, you know, to that point about helping the customer, they will often in those sessions tell us about things that are driving case volume that are known to them, issues for the customer, they're like, Yeah, this always comes up and it's a problem, you know, with billing or with provisioning this new product or whatever it is. And we're sitting there thinking and listening to what they need, but we're also thinking hmm, that's something we should go talk to product about, like I bet that should work differently than if they're telling us it's working in ideally then wouldn't drive as many support tickets.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eThe Role of AI and Future Directions for CX and EX\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDom Nicastro 19:48:\u0026nbsp;\u003c/strong\u003eThe past couple of weeks or so Sam, like give me an example of like a standout call center employee that you just had a great moment with. I'm fascinated with that interaction between call center leader and your call center manager, like someone in your shoes, someone in your team shoes, working with the front line? Is there an actual vivid moment that you can recall?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSam Stern 20:08:\u0026nbsp;\u003c/strong\u003eYeah, yeah. So we've been doing this research for the last few weeks with customer support. And I was reviewing some of the videos just this morning because we're sort of splicing together some of the clips from some of the research to sort of make a recap video. And I was watching one gentleman in our global support be interviewed by a couple of my colleagues. And what he was saying, and I think this is what's so powerful about these folks is he was talking about when he has to spend two hours on a really complex support ticket.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnd my colleague asked him, she said, doesn't that hurt your cue percentage time and your calls per hour handled? And he said, Oh, yeah, it craters it. I know, I'm done for the day, like, it's gonna be a bad day. He's like, so what I do is I communicate to my manager to tell her this is what I'm doing and she almost always backs me and supports me and she understands. And we are going to put a little note on my performance for that day. But it's the right thing to do for the customer, the customer needs that much help. And I can make a difference. And that's really inspiring to hear. He's taking a hit. Now, maybe we should justify metrics a little bit, but he's taking a hit there to do the right thing for the customer. And he's getting the support from his manager in doing it. And I just love that example.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDom Nicastro 21:20:\u0026nbsp;\u003c/strong\u003eThat is gold. That is gold. And to get to that point, Sam, it's a credit to your team, because you have to make the effort to review and talk to these people one on one, right? I think a lot of CX leaders might get buried in the data, the KPIs, the board meetings, and all that stuff that matters, but doesn't it matter as much as that customer-facing employee working with a customer, that one on one transaction that can bring the company down? Yeah. So they need to be empowered. So I guess my question to you is like, what kind of advice do you give to CX leaders to get out of their day to day and make time? Yeah, sounds like you have a pretty good system there, you were watching some videos, then you went to the employee.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSam Stern 22:02:\u003c/strong\u003e\u0026nbsp;I do think even in this age of incredible volumes of data, and we've talked about that already. \u003ca rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://www.cmswire.com/digital-marketing/quantitative-and-qualitative-data-research-for-marketers/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Qualitative research\"\u003eQualitative research\u003c/a\u003e absolutely still has a role to play, getting this kind of rich feedback. And it's so complimentary to the big sets of data that we all have access to. So I think to me, that's first is you have to be planning to prepare to do qualitative research to complement the more quantitative sets of data that we already have coming in. And then as you said, I think the power of seeing it, so it's for me, seeing it, seeing him talk about it, and show my colleague on his system where he had to spend this extra time, but then putting that video together and sharing it with our colleagues to show them because they might say, well, he should have gone to this system. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnd it's like, well, look at all the tabs he has opened, do you really think he's going to find that or no, that in the moment when he's taking two chats at once with customers, when you see the employee in the convoluted systems that they're going through on screen on video, and you hear them talking about it, that is unassailable, people can push back on that that's just real. And so we really like to use that we're trying to do that more and more these days by showing the videos to our colleagues, when we present when we do the deliverables, to highlight some of the key findings and the research and the sessions that we hold. That's the evidence that's hardest for people to look away from is what I found.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eLeveraging Journey Mapping for Enhanced Customer and Employee Experiences\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDom Nicastro 23:18:\u0026nbsp;\u003c/strong\u003eHaving those insights is just amazing. And I know, your team really focuses on that qualitative research, like you said, in the journey mapping to I know, journey mapping, and we haven't really talked about that. And a lot of folks talk about employee journey mapping and customer journey mapping. But it sounds like you guys are really doubling down on that customer journey mapping. How do we get there? How do you get to that point? And sort of where do you start?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSam Stern 23:42:\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u003c/strong\u003eSo yes, we do a lot of journey mapping, both \u003ca rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://www.cmswire.com/customer-experience/surviving-the-journey-of-customer-journey-mapping/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"customer and employee journey mapping\"\u003ecustomer and employee journey mapping\u003c/a\u003e when we're looking at the employee experience. And it flows from the data that we have access to from experience, insights team and the qualitative research that we do. So we sort of, you know, we start there. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnd then a lot of what we're doing, we're aiming to do with with conducting that research with ingesting that data, is to start to turn it into a rich understanding of the experience from end to end, which is every CX Pro on Earth basically is finding that it's best visualized through a journey map. So that's how we do it too. And what I found it's been really valuable since the pandemic and I think a lot of folks have found this is we now do it all digitally, all remote, and it makes it really easy to have collaboration with our colleagues to get their inputs to the journey map. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSo you know if we're going to look at okay, well, what is the process that underpins these steps in the journey for the employee to talk to the business process team and get their input for that part? What are the metrics these employees are being held to we get that from the managers and that team, we can end the journey with go one by one, we can have people review it, we can share it with people, I found that that's a really powerful way to sort of open up those conversations with our cross functional partners by taking time to sort of show them the journey map, walk them through it and also get their inputs and almost in real time with them on the call with us sharing our screen. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAdd their input to the map, so they can see that it's there. And it's included. The other thing I'll say, though, is we also do a lot of service blueprinting and future state journey mapping. And again, it's really just sort of you wanting to capture the current state and understand what's working and what's not. But we don't want to wallow in the pain that we're causing our customers, our employees. So we want to make sure as well to frame up what it could be like if we addressed some of the issues that we found in the current state map. So that's the other technique, I think is important is to sort of not only document what's happening today, but to help colleagues imagine what's possible tomorrow.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDom Nicastro 25:34:\u0026nbsp;\u003c/strong\u003eCan you recall any changes recently from these journey mapping sessions and learnings and these cross functional calls, like anything that's recently made a big change because of your journey mapping work?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSam Stern 25:47:\u0026nbsp;\u003c/strong\u003eThis is going back a couple of years. But this was a project we had worked on, we found that there was maybe not enough of a ritual around a customer's ad campaign experience on the site. What I mean is when they run a campaign marketing campaign, they get the results back, it's sort of just here the results, here's the dashboard, there was an opportunity there to help them memorialize it, you know, for the first campaign, if it was a really successful campaign, if it was going to lead to these business results. And that came out of doing research for customers, what are they going to do with the data? \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhat are they going to do with the results from the campaign, and we saw that it was like, this is something where there's real alignment between that individual customer and LinkedIn, assuming it's successful, it has to be successful as a campaign, if it is, they want to celebrate that they want to talk about that internally, it's good for their personal brand, it's good for their professional development and how they're seen among their team.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBut also they want their colleagues, you know, the sales team who's gonna follow up on leads other colleagues in the marketing department, they want them to know that it was successful. So that was an example of something we found in \u003ca rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://www.cmswire.com/customer-experience/customer-journey-mapping-a-how-to-guide/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"journey mapping\"\u003ejourney mapping\u003c/a\u003e. We've got to do more to help them turn that into a milestone around the results of the campaign coming back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eEnhancing Human and Customer Experiences: The Integral Role of Generative AI at LinkedIn\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDom Nicastro 26:53:\u0026nbsp;\u003c/strong\u003eWe've gone like 30 plus minutes, Sam, and I did not ask a question about AI. How did I miss it? I mean, my goodness, there is that question. We gotta get to it. You guys have been around a long time, but November 2022 we know that was a big moment with \u003ca rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://www.cmswire.com/digital-experience/chatgpt-what-you-need-to-know/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"ChatGPT and OpenAI and generative AI\"\u003eChatGPT and OpenAI and generative AI\u003c/a\u003e really specifically? So are technologies like generative AI being implemented successfully with you guys? And if so, what have been some of the outcomes?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSam Stern 27:22:\u003c/strong\u003e Yes, LinkedIn is owned by Microsoft, for anyone who doesn't know that. So Microsoft is at the heart of everything that's happening.\u0026nbsp;But so you know, Microsoft, the partnership with ChatGPT, all the things that they're doing for their clients, we're working with them on using their capabilities with our clients. And so yes, it is making its way into the experience, primarily for customers. Now, as they're doing things that they do on our site, launching marketing campaigns, writing job postings, they get AI systems that you may have noticed as a member you can there's AI features to help you write posts. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eNow, there are AI features to help you summarize articles. I think I mentioned that earlier. So this is getting infused everywhere. But it's becoming something we're starting to use for employees, co-pilot to help employees get access to information that might be in disparate systems that might be buried, giving suggestions about things to recommend to a customer. So yeah, we're seeing it show up everywhere. The use cases being for now primarily, like, let's augment what the customer is wanting to do anyway, write this post, if it's a member, or write this job description, if it's a customer, help them make it better. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnd if it's an employee, help them deliver a better experience, I say for now, because that's sort of like human assist. It's other places, it's popping up where it's a primary interface. And I think as we keep going with AI, it will become more of that where it's AI to customer or AI to AI, the AI on the other side acting on behalf of the customer themselves. But right now, it's a lot of that human assist.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDom Nicastro 28:58:\u0026nbsp;\u003c/strong\u003eYou can't write an AI assistant post on LinkedIn without a couple of nice emojis next to it. Like, you know, if this is going to be great for business momentum, you have to have a rocket ship next to it. That's right. That's that's the deal. Sam, you know that this has been great. I'd really like to do a couple more things. One, I'd love for you to just wrap this whole conversation up. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnd I think my big takeaway is the moment with that gentleman in the global call center. Yeah, and to me, that's a heck of an illustration of employee experience meets customer experience where you're using analytics, you using qualitative, you're using one to one face to face it's just like everything is involved in that so what would be your big takeaway from this Sam you know, talking to a fellow CX leader in your shoes that really wants to do more of this combination of EX and CX because I think that's the gold star this Convo for me. Yeah.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSam Stern 29:50:\u0026nbsp;\u003c/strong\u003eSo go into those efforts to understand and learn to find parts of the experience to fix. Go in with humility. It's been easy for us. LinkedIn is a big organization. So we're like, well, we don't really understand how this works. And embrace that mindset. I don't understand how this works, because then it allows you to explore, it allows you to ask the dumb questions. And we've learned a lot by doing that. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhen my colleague asked that gentleman about, what are the studio metrics, she was asking for a position she truly didn't know. How did he balance that? And by asking those questions, you get to deeper insights. And I think that's a really valuable mindset to embrace for CX professionals is, if you are in a position where you don't know a lot about what's happening, great. Embrace your ignorance, if you feel like you know, really try and dial back and think what am I assuming is true, or what might be different from the last time we did this research, because that allows you to uncover new insights, new perspectives, nuances to your understanding that maybe you hadn't explored yet. And that's where we get into these opportunities to make real \u003ca rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://www.cmswire.com/customer-experience/current-state-of-digital-customer-experience-in-2024/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"unique experiences\"\u003eunique experiences\u003c/a\u003e or real upgrades to the experience that we might have missed if we hadn't embraced that mindset.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDom Nicastro 30:56:\u0026nbsp;\u003c/strong\u003eLove it. And lastly, I'm going to give you an opportunity for a shout out because it sounds like Sam that you might have done a few podcasts here and there. So I think you might even have your own. So go ahead. Give us the details. I'd love to hear about it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSam Stern 31:08:\u0026nbsp;\u003c/strong\u003eYes, thank you. Yes.

And by the way, awesome job on my name, that is to use customer experience lingo and you have an LTR of 10.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eLeading the Charge in Consumer-Centric Revolution\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eNicastro: \u003c/strong\u003eNet Promoter Score’s high already right off the bat, customer effort score is good. All right, that's a good start, Sri. Sri, you know, I think a lot of our listeners, customer experience, leaders are always fascinated to know how the team lines up within your organization, where you sit, who's around you, that kind of thing. So I would love to know who we're talking about, you know, how many people are involved here? And what are the primary objectives of your team?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eNarasimhan: \u003c/strong\u003eI'll start with a little bit of a vision for CVS. You know, Karen Lynch, when she took the job said that she wanted to be the most consumer centric company in healthcare. And around that she actually brought in a chief customer officer, Michelle Peluso to really ignite and drive that vision. So my organization as the head of enterprise customer experience sits in a central role within the organization and spans all of our different business units. So retail Aetna, Caremark, healthcare delivery, we cover it all. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnd what I have in terms of structure is I have a group that's focused on measurements to making sure we take all the data, we get 17 million pieces of feedback, just from surveys around the company, all the social media data we get and other data that we would collect internally and making sure we drive action on it. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnd then a big function I have is around what I call change management and strategy. But I don't think we'd be successful unless each of these business units aligned up and really leaned in with so each business we work with, has a function dedicated and the way I like to put it as we were so adamant and so forceful in our \u003ca rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://www.cmswire.com/customer-experience/how-can-your-organization-truly-be-customer-centric/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"desire to be consumer centric\"\u003edesire to be consumer centric\u003c/a\u003e, they created organizations to deal with us.

It's almost like becoming a core KPI or a core principle of customer experience is delivering great employee experience. And the CX people are the ones to do that. Because they have the data. They're good at data. They're good at analyzing data and making actionable outcomes out of it plans, KPIs, how much of your job would you say is employee experience?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eNarasimhan: \u003c/strong\u003eYeah, you know, it's a great point, even if you walk into a store, and there's a positive energy in the store, and you can see the employees are happy being with each other, you feel that as a consumer, and you want to be there, you want to be a part of that experience. And I always say that no one walks into their job saying they want to do a bad job, right? \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThere's a ton of positive intent, you always have a why, for why you join an organization. And it's our job as leaders to help unlock that why, move the obstacles out of the way, so that you're really able to live that and deliver the best in class experience that I'm sure you wake up every day wanting to do and particularly for an organization like CVS Health, we're managing people's healthcare, this is an awesome opportunity to impact someone's life. And I think what we really focus on is creating the mindset where you're saying, I can't wait to help this consumer, I can't wait to help this patient versus Oh, man, this is another inbound call. So it's a huge part. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnd one of the big things we've done culturally is really embedded, what I'd call \u003ca rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://www.cmswire.com/customer-experience/understand-serve-listen-building-your-house-of-the-customer/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"service standards\"\u003eservice standards\u003c/a\u003e. And the focus has really been on things that everyone would know to do. But it's one of those things where if you reinforce and focus on it, you can create this environment and it becomes a part of your DNA. So I'd say a large portion of what we do is really trying to drive frontline engagement, frontline learning, but also this cultural aspect where we put the consumer at the center and really unlock the potential of those frontline employees through activities like service standards recognition, and making sure that we create a culture where you just can't wait to talk to the member or the patient.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRelated Article: \u003ca rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://www.cmswire.com/customer-experience/3-ways-to-improve-ex-and-cx-at-the-same-time/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"3 Ways to Improve EX and CX at the Same Time\"\u003e3 Ways to Improve EX and CX at the Same Time\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eEmpowering Frontline With Service Standards\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eNicastro: \u003c/strong\u003eYeah, that service standards concept is fascinating because it sounds like it's empowering the frontline to always have something to be measured by like, Hey, look at this example, that was part of X service standard, or Y service standard. Do you have any examples of what some of the service standards are?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eNarasimhan:\u003c/strong\u003e Well, there's a couple of different ways we approach it. One is just as an example, making sure that when someone walks in to our store, or calls into one of our call centers, that we always provide a warm greeting. And I know that seems simple. And you probably hear that all the time. But it does change the whole tenor of the call or the interaction, when you come up with that warm greeting. Now, everyone knows to do that. But it's one of those things where it doesn't hurt to reinforce because if you think about it, you have to be intentional about these things. And you have to actually say like, Hey, this is something that's important that we do every time. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eYou know, it's not necessarily something we want to create, like a stick around. So, you know, it's not like something we measure formally. But as we start training and practicing and embedding, you start seeing that become a core part of what people do. The other thing that I think is really important is we take a lot of pride in \u003ca rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://www.cmswire.com/customer-experience/the-holistic-equation-why-hx-cx-ex/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"creating engagement between the consumer and our frontline employees\"\u003ecreating engagement between the consumer and our frontline employees\u003c/a\u003e. So through activities like closing the loop, we want to create a dialogue where you're learning and getting better in real time. So I think a lot of the best CX organizations do this, but we free the data, we get as much of that information to the frontline employee. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSo they can learn, they can get better, they can adapt as they go. And it creates this sense of because you're seeing the feedback in real time. It creates this culture of wanting to deliver that great experience because you can see the result. And one of the things that we have that's I think tremendous is videos. And you'll see some of these videos, particularly from our specialty patients, where it's emotional, these are really complex conditions. These are complex situations that these patients are in, and our reps are helping them navigate that. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnd just the way you hear the patient talk about the interaction with a rep is meaningful to someone like me, it wasn't even involved in the interaction. Now imagine if you're that rep and you're able to see the impact you have. It creates this positive cycle that perpetuates this feeling of wanting to be a part of that patient's life and wanting to really be a partner with them and healthcare, which is what we're driving towards.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRelated Article: \u003ca rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://www.cmswire.com/customer-experience/what-defines-world-class-customer-service-now-and-how-to-get-there/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"What Defines World-Class Customer Service Now and How to Get There\"\u003eWhat Defines World-Class Customer Service Now and How to Get There\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eFrontline Employees Are Key to Brand and Service Excellence\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eNicastro:\u003c/strong\u003e Yeah, \u003ca rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://www.cmswire.com/customer-experience/the-secret-for-any-customer-experience-strategy-listen-to-frontline-employees/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"the front line and customer interaction\"\u003ethe front line and customer interaction\u003c/a\u003e is like the most important thing that happens in a company's day, isn't it? It's like more important than any board meeting. No offense to your team, Sri. Anything you guys are talking about on a Zoom or a board meeting, empowering those frontline agents? Is everything like what level do you take that because it can be a thankless job sometimes because the consumer is having a frustrating day, like you said, it's emotional, health care, very sensitive. And powering that front line. It seems like everything.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eNarasimhan: \u003c/strong\u003eThe way I always think about it is they are really the tip of the spear. And in many ways they carry the weight of the organization. Those individual interactions, millions of them that occur, to your point are, what develop and what create your brand and what create how you're considered and thought of as a company. So making sure those people are equipped again to tap into their why to tap into their positive intent. Because there's some of the best people we have organizationally, the more we can equip them and get those blockers out of the way, get those issues out of the way that prevent them from achieving and serving our customers in the best way, the better off we'll be.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRelated Article: \u003ca rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://www.cmswire.com/customer-experience/the-best-cx-lessons-from-real-customer-conversations/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"The Best CX Lessons From Real Customer Conversations\"\u003eThe Best CX Lessons From Real Customer Conversations\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eStrategic Integration of Consumer Centricity at CVS\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eNicastro: \u003c/strong\u003eYou have to build consumer centricity and you have to live behind that promise.

Just kidding. But that is actually we've been more so than any other organization I've been a part of taking a very intentional approach to trying to \u003ca rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://www.cmswire.com/customer-experience/customer-centric-strategy-winning-big-with-compromise/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"drive consumer centricity\"\u003edrive consumer centricity\u003c/a\u003e. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnd I'd say there's really four things, we're focused on one, do we have a consistent view and \u003ca rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://www.cmswire.com/customer-experience/20-customer-experience-metrics-critical-for-your-business/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"measurement of the consumer experience\"\u003emeasurement of the consumer experience\u003c/a\u003e across all the various touchpoints that we have? And as we came in the organization, that's one of the first things we did we said, hey, can we move to a consistent platform, a consistent way to measure. \u003ca rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://www.cmswire.com/customer-experience/what-is-the-net-promoter-score/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"We chose NPS as our measurement.\"\u003eWe chose NPS as our measurement.\u003c/a\u003e I mean, you can choose whatever I think is most meaningful to you. The reason we picked NPS is we felt like it was a higher standard than say, you know, any other transactional metrics, but we use other metrics too. And data to make sure we have a clearer picture of what the consumer is experiencing.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSecond, we want to, as we talked about already, drive that action at the front line. So \u003ca rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://www.cmswire.com/analytics/data-democratization-is-key-for-businesses-navigating-covid-19/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"democratize the data\"\u003edemocratize the data\u003c/a\u003e as much as possible to make sure that all of our frontline employees, corporate employees, everyone has access to what the consumer is feeling and what the consumer is seeing. So that we can make really meaningful change, coach at the frontline, learn at the frontline, but also from all of our employees across the organization, embed the consumer in what we're doing.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe third part I think, is really solving pervasive or systemic issues. Across the organization, we've got partners that we've built and developed, we have what we're calling out, it's a dirty word sometimes in corporate America, but SteerCos where we have actually brought these are the primary issues consumers are facing, what are we going to do to address it, and making sure that we have plans and there's been 100 plus initiatives across the organization where we are actually going to take on and address consumer feedback and make sure that we're taking care of all the systemic roadblocks that are in the way, process issues, etc, that we come across. The way I like to say it, Dom, is consumers are the best mirror. If you're looking in the mirror, and you're looking for ways to get better, there's no better place to live than a consumer and their feedback. So we've really embraced that.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then the fourth part is \u003ca rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://www.cmswire.com/customer-experience/is-your-culture-creating-a-great-customer-experience/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"cultural\"\u003ecultural\u003c/a\u003e. So building a culture of recognition, not just talking about the problem, so many organizations just focus on the problems. I think it's the way we're all wired. We're making sure that when we deliver great experiences, we're telling the agents or the store employees, great job, amazing, we create that culture where they want to do that, they want to feed that. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnd then also just making sure that, like you said, when we think about culture, putting the colleague and the consumer together, and creating that interplay and that interaction that's meaningful, so that, again, you build that virtuous cycle. So we've taken a really deliberate approach. I think we've had pretty good success so far, obviously more to do. But if you're going to approach consumer centricity, you mentioned it right up front. It's a complex problem. It's something everyone talks about, you better have a real formal definition and a real formal plan. I think we've done that. And excited to see as we continue on that journey.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRelated Article: \u003ca rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://www.cmswire.com/leadership/how-to-build-a-thriving-company-culture/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"How to Build a Thriving Company Culture\"\u003eHow to Build a Thriving Company Culture\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eUnveiling the Reality of Customer Experience\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eNicastro: \u003c/strong\u003eWell said, you know, and those four pillars, I want to go into that first one, data and analyzing that data, collecting it and making sense of it. Because I think a lot of times when you look at customers, if you've probably searched customer experience images, right on Google, you're gonna come up with a smiling front desk person and shaking hands, right? Here's the reality of what customer centricity and customer experience is, you're looking at data all day, right? And trying to figure out what your consumers are telling you through that data. So I want to ask you, the tools that your team deploys, like, what are some of the tools that you're using into you don't have to, you don't have to name the vendor name, but like, just the general concept of the tool? Is there like a central data repository that you're looking at? Or is it a little disparate? That's the reality, and you just kind of have to combine these tools and try to make them integrate and work together?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eNarasimhan:\u003c/strong\u003e First of all, I'll tell you, my parents are both scientists. And when I told them, I work in customer experience, you're totally right. I think they imagined me as one of those stock images of calling customers on the phone. But you're right, it's a very data centric role. And data is really critical to everything we do. So we use a single survey platform to send and receive feedback, right, we are on the \u003ca rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://www.cmswire.com/customer-experience/medallia-experience-24-conference-introduces-new-ai-supported-cx/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Medallia\"\u003eMedallia\u003c/a\u003e platform. One thing that we thought was critical is to make sure that we standardize that across the enterprise. And one of the key things I'd say is that the \u003ca rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://www.cmswire.com/customer-experience/conquering-the-customer-feedback-gap/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"act of soliciting feedback\"\u003eact of soliciting feedback\u003c/a\u003e is in and of itself an interaction. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnd you want to make sure you're doing that consistently because consumers know, increasingly that Caremark CVS, Aetna are the same company. And so we want to make sure that we have a consistent approach, both in terms of the look, feel and how we send the survey, but also in terms of the \u003ca rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://hbr.org/2023/07/to-get-better-customer-data-build-feedback-loops-into-your-products\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"data we're collecting\"\u003edata we're collecting\u003c/a\u003e, so that we're able to really understand the touch points across our consumer base consistently. So that's just a survey feedback. And like I said, we receive as an inbound receiver on 17 million \u003ca rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbesbusinesscouncil/2023/06/30/the-power-of-customer-feedback/?sh=392fa4c64c55\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"pieces of feedback \"\u003epieces of feedback \u003c/a\u003eannually. So huge survey program that we run and operate. One of the key things we do off that survey program too that I think is a really critical components closing the loop. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSo following up with consumers after they send us a survey, to learn more, the way I describe that, as the people doing those closing interactions are kind of like root cause analysts. A lot of times consumers aren't going to talk in the language uses internally. They're just going to say, X, Y and Z was terrible. Now that's not particularly useful for us. But when we have the agent, look at it, follow up and understand, it'll say, oh, yeah, that was related to this policy, or this procedure that we had and then we can look at those policies and procedures and get better. So we really want to leverage the \u003ca rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://www.cmswire.com/voice-of-the-customer/cmswires-top-10-voice-of-the-customer-articles-of-2023/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"voice of the customer\"\u003evoice of the customer\u003c/a\u003e through the employee through our closed loop program.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe other things we do we look at lots of data, we're looking at digital session data, call transcripts, social media data, and just SharePoint around desperate data. I think the way this industry is moving is consumers are telling you their experiences empirically, almost to the point where you don't need to ask. So we are moving more and more towards predicting those experiences. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBecause we know that if X, Y and Z happened, traditionally, you're going to be a detractor. So we can understand that and measure X, Y and Z without even asking you and follow up and get to you without even sending you a survey. So we're increasingly looking at other sources of data to help drive our decision making. And yeah, we do, we pull it all together that platform around our survey feedback is excellent. But where we really find the value is enriching it with all the operational data and information that we have organizationally, so you can really drive change.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne of the things we do in our call centers, we link NPS satisfaction to call time. And one of the things we saw is that after a certain cut point in our call center, that NPS declined dramatically. So what we did is we actually created a safety net acting on that where the supervisors informed when you hit that cut point. And they'll reach out to the agent and say, Hey, is everything okay? Do you need any help? And the agents love it, because they know now that they've got this net behind them, if they're on a complicated call, and it's just a proactive way to combine data sources and act on it. And driving action is really a critical piece of this, to make sure that we're driving the best experience. So we're doing things like that all the time, to try to make the most of all these sources of information that we're getting from consumers.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRelated Article: \u003ca rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://www.cmswire.com/customer-experience/customer-understanding-harmonizing-the-depth-and-breadth-of-research/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Customer Understanding: Harmonizing the Depth and Breadth of Research\"\u003eCustomer Understanding: Harmonizing the Depth and Breadth of Research\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eEmployees Are Key to Enhancing Customer Experience\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eNicastro:\u003c/strong\u003e And that is an absolutely critical example of \u003ca rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://www.cmswire.com/customer-experience/cx-and-ex-why-focusing-only-on-cx-is-a-bad-idea/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"employee experience meeting customer experience\"\u003eemployee experience meeting customer experience\u003c/a\u003e, you're literally inside of a call using your customer data to inform your employee that something might not be going right. And you're right involved in the middle of that transaction with the consumer in real time. That's powerful. Like if you can do that. And that means you're walking the walk with employee experience meeting customer experience, to that effect, do you actually tie in things like EPS, right, your Employee Promoter Score, things like that? Is that something your team handles? Or is it more like on an HR side of things?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eNarasimhan:\u003c/strong\u003e So we partner with HR, HR runs those survey programs? Well, what we do though, is we leverage that data heavily. And I think you're right, that connection is really critical. And one of the examples I'll share is that, again, both in our \u003ca rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://www.cmswire.com/contact-center/16-important-call-center-statistics-to-know-about/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"call center \"\u003ecall center \u003c/a\u003ein our stores, when you see a new consumer interact with a new rep, experiences tend to be poor, when you have a new consumer system and new to Aetna. They're trying to learn, they want to learn about how everything works, and how do they actually access their coverage. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIf you put them with a new rep, who’s also learning makes sense, right? Those are going to be poor experiences. So can we actually get smart about that and move like a newer rep that we know is probably looking for more information about what they're getting in their plan with someone who's more seasoned, who understands all that nuance. So those are the other things we look at all the time, it's more like also, in addition to the \u003ca rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://www.cmswire.com/customer-experience/unifying-customer-employee-engagement/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"employee engagement \"\u003eemployee engagement \u003c/a\u003edata that you're referencing, the empirical data. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnother quick example, if you look in our stores, stores that have challenges with attrition, typically have a lower NPS. And so what you want to do, because you know, you're moving employees in and out, so you want to look at that as a root cause of the problem. So what can you do to solve that, and we work leadership all the time, because we monitor that to say, hey, like, you know, if we can solve that problem in the store, it will CMPs improve. So taking it a step further beyond just as employee engagement scores, which we work with a ton. We're trying to get also to some of those operational metrics. So again, it becomes more actionable for us as we work with the field.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRelated Article: \u003ca rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://www.cmswire.com/digital-workplace/why-organizations-should-care-about-employee-engagement/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Why Organizations Should Care About Employee Engagement\"\u003eWhy Organizations Should Care About Employee Engagement\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eNet Promoter Score: The Northstar Metric for CX\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eNicastro: \u003c/strong\u003eYeah, there's a lot of CX leaders out there that obsess over, you know, a couple of metrics, couple of KPIs. It sounds like you guys are doubling down on a lot of these metrics. But is there something that you and your day like every quarter, you really are bearing down laser focusing on one or two or two or three KPIs? Like, is there something that stands out? That really drives a lot of your decision making over these kind of subset KPIs? Like these are the little ones we do care about, but they're not really driving? A lot of? So what I'm getting at is what are the main KPIs for you?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eNarasimhan:\u003c/strong\u003e Yeah, it's a great question. As I mentioned, I'm a pretty data centric guy, came from a family of scientists. If you're asking for me, I use like,\u003ca rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://www.cmswire.com/customer-experience/5-cx-kpis-companies-are-improving-with-ai/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\" I use multiple KPIs\"\u003e I use multiple KPIs\u003c/a\u003e. But organizationally, it's important that probably communicate a North Star. Right. I think if you're going to drive this consumer centricity change, picking a Northstar metric is critical and I think a lot of people get caught up in what is that metric. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnd frankly, my opinion, Dom, is you pick one that you like, and you stick with it consistently, because that's what you need to rally people around. And for us, that was Net Promoter Score. It's something that again, we felt like the standard was higher, because what's the most common complaint about Net Promoter Score is, you're asking about the brand, not about me, or the experience I delivered. What I often say to people when they get that is, well, don't we all own this brand. We all own it together, right. So it creates a more of a sense of community around the experience and aligns people to the broader challenges. So it's not just like this is the contact center score. This is the store score. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhen you're dealing with NPS. It's our score, and you can rally your organization more dramatically to improve experience. So NPS is our North Star. A few of the others, though, that we look at and are increasingly looking at, are things like churn. If we look at our extra care membership and the front store, we're looking at things like the links in terms of utilization and claims and Aetna and Caremark we're looking at metrics around the refill experience. So we try to, I think you're hearing a consistent theme for me. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWe love the survey metrics, we think they're really important. We're enriching that as much as we possibly can with the consumer metrics that we collect as an organization. Because I think you want to get a balanced scorecard view. So ideally, you have NPS and some of these other critical metrics that link to experience all in one place. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSo that you really get a balanced view of what's going on in your organization. So kind of a combination, NPS is our North Star. But we use a lot of the business KPIs as well, especially those that we have discovered that link to NPS adherence is another example, to make sure that we have as much of a view of the consumer holistically as we possibly can.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRelated Article: \u003ca rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://www.cmswire.com/customer-experience/net-promoter-score-top-3-impactful-trends/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Net Promoter Score: Top 3 Impactful Trends\"\u003eNet Promoter Score: Top 3 Impactful Trends\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFrontline Agents Transform Challenges Into Positives\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eNicastro: \u003c/strong\u003eAll those layers, you talked about baked into what the NPS outcome is. And I think the best example you mentioned was that you're correlating NPS into these calls in real time, and delivering kind of an outcome or a pivot, right, you're delivering a pivot. And those agents, those frontline agents in the call center, they need support, man. Yeah, it's a thankless job sometimes, I mean, I can say it over and over again in this podcast, but no one calls a call center to say, hey, just letting you know, I'm really happy and you're doing a great job.

I marvel at our people, they are some of the best. And I marvel at the fact that you could have someone coming in so hot, and leaving so happy. And they do it time and time again.

And I can never figure out culture, I'll be honest, you know, it's hard to measure like, you know, culture score, like how do you do that? So what ultimately are you trying to get at when you talk about building a culture of customer centricity? You know, I've heard people say things like, oh, this employee is a great fit into our culture like, and that sounds like kind of clannish to me, right? Like they are part of our culture. You want people that are unique and different, and bring different aspects to your culture and challenge you a bit. But anyway, like, what does it mean, in terms of consumer experience? And culture? Like how do you how do you guys view that? How do you get there,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eNarasimhan: \u003c/strong\u003eYou make a really good point, you don't want to make culture, this box that everyone fits into, right? And I think that, you know, American society, you want diversity, you want people that are bringing different experiences, challenges and skills to the table. For us, I think if you're talking about the culture, we want to build across our entire organization. It's really straightforward to me, it's putting the consumer at the center of everything we do. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnd I think what you see is a lot of people think they're doing that, or trying to do that, but maybe need that framework or that sense of what does that actually mean, to help drive that and, you know, I'll give you an example. I see organizations all the time, develop products, and then push that on the consumer, right? You see it constantly. It's like, Hey, I made this product. How do we market it to the consumer? I think what we want to do, and we're trying to do increasingly, is embed that voice of the customer into a lot of those decisions we're making both in terms of our product development or operations, how we approach, you know, our day to day, we want to start with the consumer and then build the process. And some of that's going to take some time to unwind because organizations across the world have always started with the product. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBut I think like, that's where we're going. It's Hey, like, it's awesome to see across the organization especially our Caremark businesses. You know, I'm just thinking about some of the processes we built, where we actually come to the table and say, like, hey, is this actually the optimal consumer experience? And it's really interesting in some of the recent initiatives I've been in, the first thing people talk about isn't expense reduction, it isn't operational efficiency. When they're talking about these initiatives, the first thing they say is NPS consumer experience. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSecond thing, right, or one A is colleague experience. And that's what we want organizationally, we want the first metric you think about to be the consumer. Because ultimately, I think that's what drives growth. And that's what drives all the things that we want as an organization, all those financial impacts that comes from that. So that's it. I mean, I think it's a complicated question. I think our answer is simple. We want to put the consumer at the front of everything we do.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRelated Article:\u0026nbsp;\u003ca rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://www.cmswire.com/customer-experience/the-secret-to-creating-a-customer-focused-culture/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"The Secret to Creating a Customer-Focused Culture\"\u003eThe Secret to Creating a Customer-Focused Culture\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003eDeep Dive into Customer Centricity at CVS\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eNicastro:\u003c/strong\u003e Well, I'm happy, Sri, to be on the advisory board, because I'm a customer too you know, CVS, we go there. And I'll tell you, sometimes you guys don't have those extra peanut butter, Reese's hearts that my wife likes, you know, because I like to put those next to the medicine when I check out. And you got to step up your game with those.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eNarasimhan:\u003c/strong\u003e I'm already on the phone, Dom.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eNicastro: \u003c/strong\u003eDom Nicastro says, Hey, this has been such a nice deep dive into you know, how you guys operate and how you look at customer centricity. I'd like to just wrap it up with like, you know, your one big takeaway, like someone listening to this saying, hey, you know, this all sounds great. We want to get off the ground doing something like this, something where we have, you know, four or five pillars of customer centricity. And we trickle that down to the frontline, how do we empower our teams to do it? So if you're talking to someone similar in your role, like a chief customer officer, VP of customer experience, you know, what's step one? Where do they get going?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eNarasimhan:\u003c/strong\u003e To me? I think it's, I start with intentionality. So start with the vision, what do you want to be? I think that came for us from the top of the organization. And I think that's also really important building alignment from the very senior leadership that you have. I mean, for our, in our case, it's, you know, Karen Lynch, and Michelle Palusa the top top of our org, build that vision. And then I think you have to be intentional about your approach. Consumer centricity is a huge buzzword out there. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnd I think buzzwords, if you don't have a really deliberate plan, you often can lose the messaging and lose the focus that you need to actually embed this organizationally. So far. In our case, it was those four pillars I laid out, be consistent about how you measure, democratizing information and data, solve those pervasive issues, and then build up the virtuous cycle through culture recognition, service standards. So I think those are kind of the critical places to start.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI'd also say I think, another thing for me, big learning for me is being nimble with the organization, particularly in a place like CVS, different parts of the organizations will be at different levels of maturity, as you go through this. So it can't be a one size fits all, for every group you work with. You have to meet them where they are, to some extent, and drive them forward in the way that will be most effective to that organization. So your messaging, the way you talk about the way I talk to retail, might be different in the way I talk to Aetna or Caremark just because they're different organizations, and they listen and respond to different messages. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnd then the last piece I'd say that I think hopefully came clear in this is yes, you want to North Star metric 100%, you want to pick one, to rally people around, but you have to be able and willing to use all the disparate sources of information and data that you have coming in. Because I think CX as a discipline is a very data centric discipline. And the way that you actually achieve change is through data based, actionable recommendations. And one of the things we didn't even hit on is even leveraging customer comments and all those unstructured data elements that you bring in, we use heavily use text analytics. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eYou want to make sure that you have a really strong plan to give database recommendations. Because I think often CX gets thought of as kind of soft and squishy. It's not. To me, it's very focused day to day discipline that's really designed to drive operational change. And I'll add one more I know so that was the last one but one more can consumers are the mirror, listen to the consumers, but you can't just listen. Because there's nothing worse than just listening and not doing anything. You got to act. And you got to build the mechanisms and process for action.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eNicastro:\u003c/strong\u003e Well, Sri thanks for the wrap up.
