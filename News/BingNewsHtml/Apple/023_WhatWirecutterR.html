Cordless and rechargeable. Many testers called this their go-to toy for clitoral stimulation. Offers great variation in intensity and vibration patterns. Durable with an easy-to-clean silicone head. Quiet (but not that quiet) motor. Sufficient battery life.</p><p><strong>Other things to know:</strong> Large size can make it difficult to use in certain positions during partnered intercourse. Not waterproof. Automatically shuts off at the 20-minute mark. A beautiful toy this is not, but it gets the job done. One-year warranty. Use code <strong>WC-MAGICWAND92</strong>.</p><p>Read more: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/reviews/best-vibrators/">The Best Vibrators</a></p></div></section><section class="b6d81848

Water-resistant.</p><p><strong>Other things to know:</strong> Doesn’t have any way to ring your phone. Cannot attach to your stuff directly.

travel backpack pick. Easy accessibility. Clever tuck-away straps. Elegant way of expanding and contracting. Design is adjustable, customizable, and (if you spring for the extra cubes and organizers) an almost perfect system for photographers and gearheads.</p><p><strong>Other things to know:</strong> Lifetime warranty. Committing to the entire system of packing cubes and camera cubes adds extra cost to an already expensive bag. Not the absolute best sale we’ve seen, but a good deal.</p><p>Read more: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/reviews/best-carry-on-travel-bags/">The Best Carry-On Travel

Smoothly accelerates to its top speed of 7.5 mph.</p><p><strong>Other things to know:</strong> Doesn’t have a dynamic display screen for tracking workout vitals or streaming shows. Only a 90-day warranty. During testing we noticed the belt start to fray along the edge. Can safely accommodate up to 265 pounds, more than most models and our other pick.</p><p>Read more: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/reviews/best-under-desk-treadmills/">The Best Under-Desk

best noise-cancelling headphones. They sound good and are very comfortable. A test tone calibrates the noise reduction to your ear shape, and it works well, reducing a lot of noise in the airplane band.</p><p><strong>Other things to know:</strong> Available in four colors. Noise reduction is second only to that of the Apple AirPods Max and a little better than that of our previous top pick, the discontinued Bose 700. Not as many bonus features as the price suggests.

Corners and edges will get more wear and tear in high-traffic areas. We specifically highlight this rug in our guide, but Ruggable offers a variety of options in multiple patterns and sizes.

Comes in two sizes.</p><p><strong>Other things to know:</strong> Great for buyers upgrading from an older Apple Watch. Includes two temperature sensors, car-crash detection, emergency SOS, an always-on display, sleep apnea detection, and faster charging than on previous models. Doesn’t support Apple’s blood-oxygen measurement, which older models featured. 42 mm version available in jet black, rose gold, and silver case with denim band. 46 mm model is also on sale, as well as

people who want the lightest fit. Provides superior underfoot support while still offering a trail feel. Ultra-comfy and the most lightweight of our picks. Customizable fit and the best lacing system of any boot we’ve tried. Breathable with solid waterproofing.</p><p><strong>Other things to know:</strong> Tend to run big, so we recommend ordering a half-size down from your street-shoe size. Made with mostly recycled materials. On sale in multiple colors in most women’s sizes.
