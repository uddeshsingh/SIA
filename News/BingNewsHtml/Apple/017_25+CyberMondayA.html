If you were waiting to pull the trigger on a new <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/reviews/the-ipad-is-the-best-tablet/">iPad</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/reviews/best-smartwatch-iphone/">Apple Watch</a>, or <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/reviews/best-macbooks/">MacBook</a>, today is the last day of the year you’ll find a good deal.</p><p>I’ll be honest: The Apple products we’ve rigorously tested are worth paying full price for. The company issues major software upgrades every year with new features that even older devices benefit from, which means the iPad or MacBook you buy today will remain fresh for years to come (with some care and cleaning, of course).</p><p>But every dollar counts, which is why the Wirecutter Deals team has been tracking prices on all the Apple gear we recommend to curate the Cyber Monday discounts that are worth your time.</p><p>Whether you’re looking for a gift for a loved one or a gift for yourself—I’m personally on the hunt for a new MacBook—now is the perfect time to buy.</p><p>For even more deals, visit our collection of the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/money/best-cyber-monday-deals-2024-1202/">very best Cyber Monday

Comfortable design with backlit keys and good tactile feedback. Case separates from keyboard to protect iPad when you’re not typing. Two viewing angles. Pairs with up to two devices. Other things to know: Wider and heavier than some competitors, but the extra bulk isn’t severe, and it brings added functionality. Read more: The Best iPad Pro Keyboard Cases ESR Rebound Magnetic Case for iPad Pro (11-inch, M4) — Budget Pick Amazon deal price: $14; street price: $17 What we like: Our budget iPad Pro case pick. Basic, lightweight, and solid. Has Apple Pencil charging and storage. Front trifold cover can put your iPad Pro in sleep/wake mode and can fold into two stand modes, one for viewing and one for writing. Strong magnets keep iPad Pro securely attached. Grants easy access to your tablet’s ports, buttons, and speakers. Other things to know: Doesn’t provide the complete protection that our top pick offers. Deal on the black version. Read more: The Best iPad Pro Cases Tomtoc 360° Protective Sleeve (14-inch MacBook Pro) — Budget Pick Amazon deal price: $20; street price: $29 What we like: Our budget pick for the best laptop sleeve and MacBook Pro case. Fits laptops better and offers more protection than most similarly priced options. The stiff polyester fabric is a little more water-resistant than that of some of our other picks. Other things to know: Its front pocket, which barely holds a laptop charger, adds bulk. Surprisingly attractive but not particularly sleek or refined. Deal price is for the black sleeves that fit a 14-inch MacBook Pro; other on-sale colors are slightly higher. Read more: The Best Laptop Sleeves and MacBook Cases Apple Pencil (1st Generation) — Top Pick Walmart deal price: $60; street price: $100 Amazon deal price: $60; street price: $100 What we like: The best stylus for drawing on entry-level iPads. Lightweight and comfortable. Deft enough for professional illustration and calligraphy. Pressure sensitivity for precision line control. Other things to know: Works only with iPads introduced since 2015. Does not charge wirelessly like the 2nd-gen Apple Pencil. One-year Apple warranty. Read more: The Best Stylus for Your iPad Logitech MX Keys S Wireless Keyboard For Mac — Best For Amazon deal price: $93; street price: $110 What we like: The best full-size wireless keyboard for Mac. Offers a comfortable typing experience due to its well-spaced square keys. Has a backlight. Can pair with three devices via Bluetooth or a USB dongle. Other things to know: Takes up way more desk space than our top pick. Battery life is shorter. Comparatively expensive. On sale in space gray. Read more: The Best Bluetooth and Wireless Keyboards Logitech MX Master 3S Wireless Mouse for Mac — Upgrade Pick Amazon deal price: $85; street price: $100 Best Buy deal price: $85; street price: $100 What we like: Our upgrade pick for the best wireless mouse for Mac users. Comfortable to use all day—especially for larger hands—and has a thumb-scroll wheel and five other programmable buttons. Can connect to up to three devices via Bluetooth. Battery lasts about two months on a charge. Other things to know: This Mac version does not come with a USB dongle. Testers with the smallest hands found it overly large. Logi Options+ software required to customize its buttons and sensitivity. A couple of bucks higher than what we saw during Prime Day but still a good deal. Read more: The Best Wireless Mouse Kate Spade Pavé Scallop Link Apple Watch Band — Top Pick Amazon deal price: $70; street price: $100 What we like: A stainless steel version of our favorite Apple Watch jewelry band. This stainless steel bracelet dresses up the Apple Watch for fancy occasions and has removable links that don’t require tools for adjustments. Folding clasp hides where the bracelet starts and ends. Other things to know: Fits only the 38 mm and 40 mm watch sizes. Deal only on the rose gold finish. Read more: Apple Watch Bands We Like Spigen Lite Fit Apple Watch Band — Top Pick Amazon deal price: $16; street price: $20 What we like: Our top pick for the best alternative to Apple’s Sport Loop. More affordable, and one of the lightest and most comfortable bands we’ve tested. Stays put all day. Minimalist aesthetic goes with anything. Accommodates many wrist sizes. Other things to know: Material takes a while to dry, so not the best option if you like to wear your watch swimming or in the shower. Deal on black.

Read more: The Best iPad Pro Keyboard Cases Totallee Superthin Case for iPhone 16 — Top Pick Amazon deal price: $20; street price: $39 What we like: Our top pick for a superthin iPhone case. Measures only half a millimeter thick and weighs less than an ounce. Offers a bump to protect your camera lenses, covers your phone’s buttons, and provides accessible cutouts for the USB-C port and Camera Control button. Supports MagSafe for wireless charging and attaching accessories. Other things to know: Doesn’t provide the best grip and can’t protect your phone much against drops. It also doesn’t handle scratches well—they are noticeable in good lighting, which is an issue we’ve found with other superthin cases.
