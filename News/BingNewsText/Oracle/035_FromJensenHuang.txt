    "maintext": "It's been a good year for the stock market. It's been an even better year for the billionaires who own huge sums of its best-performing companies.\nFor Meta founder Mark Zuckerberg, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang, and Tesla CEO Elon Musk, the already eye-watering net worth of the world's richest has leapt this year as the market has rallied largely on an AI boom.\nWith the U.S. election uncertainty now over\u2014and analysts looking ahead to a regulation-lite environment with a Wall Street veteran as Treasury Secretary\u2014the trajectory for the rest of the year and into 2025 looks fairly stable.\nThe gains for the world's richest have already been immense.\nElon Musk net worth\nLeading the pack is\u2014perhaps unsurprisingly\u2014the world's richest man, Elon Musk.\nMusk's fortunes have been buoyed by EV-maker Tesla's growth throughout the year\u2014up more than 37% from the start of 2024 at the time of writing.\nNot only has Tesla become an AI darling with its promises of autonomous cabs and full self-driving software (plus, let's not forget the robots), but Musk's big bet on Trump has paid off.\nThe X owner admitted he would have been \u201cf\u2013ked\u201d if Trump had lost the election, having donated tens of millions of dollars to the Republican campaign.\nWhile Musk has earned himself an administration position for his proposal for a Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), Tesla shareholders have been particularly motivated by Trump's change in tone on EVs.\nThe former president previously said EV drivers are \u201c[destroying] our once great USA\u201d and should \u201crot in hell\u201d but on the campaign trail did a U-turn, telling supporters: \u201cI\u2019m for electric cars; I have to be because Elon endorsed me very strongly.\"\nAs a result of a supportive outlook for EVs direct from the next Oval Office, Tesla\u2014and correspondingly Musk's\u2014fortunes have spiked.\nAt the time of writing, Musk has added $119 billion to his fortune so far this year per the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.\nLarry Ellison net worth\nLarry Ellison, the founder and largest shareholder of software and technology giant Oracle, has seen the second largest boost to their wealth.\nBecause Ellison owns some 40% of the cloud applications business, his riches have boomed, reflecting Oracle's more than 83% stock price spike in 2024\u2014with Ellison's net worth growing $83.2 billion this year at the time of writing.\nOracle has been boosted by interest around artificial intelligence, but has also reported some strong financial outlooks this year.\nIn June, CEO Safra Catz said the organization had signed \u201cthe largest sales contracts in our history\u2014driven by the enormous demand for training AI large language models.\u201d\nCatz, who previously held the role of CFO at Oracle, continued: \u201cThroughout fiscal year 2025, I expect continued strong AI demand to push Oracle sales\u2026even higher.\"\nJensen Huang net worth\nRounding out the top three of 2024 wealth gains is Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang, whose net worth has leaped by some $80 billion this year.\nNvidia's year at the top is well-reported, with its share price ballooning approximately $185% this year.\nAs Huang owns a stake of around 3.5% in the business, with a market cap of more than $3.5 trillion, it's perhaps no surprise that he sits just outside the top 10 rankings of the world's richest people.\nThe leap in Huang's riches contributes to a sum of approximately $585 billion.\nOther major wealth winners\nFamiliar names round out the rest of the top 10 for fortune gains in 2024.\nMark Zuckerberg\u2014again flying high on the AI boom\u2014has seen his net worth grow to $70 billion as Meta continues to explore emerging technology and reap the rewards of its year of efficiency.\nLikewise, Amazon\u2014which is also investing heavily in the artificial intelligence race\u2014has seen its shares bump approximately 38% for the year to date.\nAmazon's founder, Washington Post owner Jeff Bezos, has seen his net worth leap almost $42 billion\u2014retaining his spot as the world's second-richest man.\nMichael Dell, the founder of the eponymous PC maker Dell, has seen his net worth leap to some $41 billion as the company he founded pivots towards artificial intelligence.\nThe trio of heirs behind the Walmart empire have also seen their net worth grow this year as consumers continued to defy Wall Street's expectations and continue spending.\nJim Walton's fortune has grown to $40.1 billion, while his siblings Alice and Rob's net worth has increased by $39.5 and $39 billion, respectively.\nRounding out the top 10 of 2024 wealth gainers this year (with one month left to go) is Thomas Peterffy, the chairman of Interactive Brokers, which specializes in equities, futures and foreign exchange trades. His net worth has grown approximately $32 billion this year.",
