    "maintext": "Max Verstappen made clear there is no love lost between him and George Russell following a controversial incident in the qualifying session of the Qatar Grand Prix on Saturday.\nThe Dutchman took pole-position ahead of the Mercedes driver, but was handed a one one-place penalty for driving \u201cunnecessarily slowly on a cool-down lap.\u201d\nWith Verstappen driving slowly in a bid to cool his tyres towards the end of Q3, he and Russell tangled at Turn 12, with the Briton forced onto the gravel as a result.\nThe Mercedes driver complained over the radio that Verstappen\u2019s behaviour had been \u201cextremely dangerous\u201d and the pair argued their case with the stewards at the end of the qualifying session.\nThe stewards sided with Russell and handed the reigning world champion a one-place penalty.\nWhile the sanction ultimately proved inconsequential as he won the race on Sunday ahead of Charles Leclerc and Oscar Piastri, Verstappen didn\u2019t mince his words when it came to Russell, who finished fourth.\n\"I was quite surprised when sitting there in the stewards' room, what was all going on,\" the Dutchman said.\n\"Honestly, very disappointing because I think we're all here, we respect each other a lot and, of course, I've been in that meeting room many times in my life, in my career with people that have raced, and I've never seen someone trying to s***w someone over that hard.\n\"And that for me [\u2026] I lost all respect [for Russell].\"\nMax Verstappen fires back at George Russell\nThe four-time world champion was even more blunt when speaking to to Dutch TV broadcaster Viaplay.\n\"He [Russell] always acts extremely polite in front of the cameras but if you sit together with him personally, he's a completely different person,\u201d he said.\n\"I truly can't stand that. Then you might as well get lost. I don't want anything to do with you.\"\nAhead of the race, Russell said he knew Verstappen was upset at being penalized and indicated he expected the Red Bull driver to be aggressive at the first corner.\n\u201cI know he is, he already told me,\u201d he told British broadcaster Sky Sports F1.\n\u201cSo it\u2019s going to be an interesting Turn 1, but at the end of the day, trying to focus on ourselves.\u201d\nVerstappen beat Russell into Turn 1 and never came under pressure from Russell, securing his ninth win of the season and a second victory in the past three races after triumphing in Brazil at the beginning of last month.\nDue to the timings of interviews after the race, Russell was not asked about Verstappen\u2019s comments.\nAccording to BBC Sport, however, Mercedes is adamant more details of the story are yet to be disclosed.\nRussell is expected to be asked about his argument with Verstappen when he faces the media on Thursday ahead of the season finale in Abu Dhabi.\nMeanwhile, Red Bull team principal Christian Horner claimed the penalty was \u201cmore based on hysterics\u201d than anything concrete.\n\u201cI did feel that George [Russell] and Mercedes made a big meal out of it, and it was unprecedented on a slow lap for Max [Verstappen] to end up with a one-place penalty,\u201d he said.\nWhy the stewards sided with George Russell\nIn their ruling, the stewards noted Russell was right in saying Verstappen should not have been on the racing line while driving slowly.\nHowever, they also took into account the Mercedes driver could clearly see the Red Bull ahead as a mitigating factor for Verstappen.\n\"The stewards regard this case as a complicated one in that clearly [Verstappen] did not comply with the race director's event notes and clearly was driving, in our determination, unnecessarily slowly considering the circumstances,\u201d the ruling read.\n\"It was obvious [Verstappen] was attempting to cool his tyres. He also could see [Russell] approaching as he looked in his mirror multiple times while on the small straight between Turns 11 and 12.\n\"Unusually, this incident occurred when neither car was on a push lap.\n\"Had [Russell] been on a push lap, the penalty would have most likely been the usual three-grid position penalty.\n\"However, in mitigation of penalty, it was obvious that [Russell] had clear visibility of [Verstappen].\"",
