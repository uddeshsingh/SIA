    "maintext": "Ketaki Vaidya joined Oracle in 2017 as a new graduate in India.\nVaidya advanced from associate software engineer to AI product manager in seven years.\nShe said that for overseas transfers, there's more than base pay to negotiate.\nKetaki Vaidya had worked in Oracle's office in Hyderabad, India, for about five years when she wanted a change.\nAs a software engineer, she was keen to be part of Silicon Valley's innovations. She negotiated a move to California in 2022 and has since transferred to Seattle.\nVaidya shared how, over seven years with Oracle, she navigated two promotions, a career change, and the international transfer.\nAssociate software engineer\nShe began her post-college career as an associate software engineer at Oracle's office in Hyderabad.\nOne of the first things Vaidya did was gauge what her entire team wanted from her instead of focusing on only her supervisor.\n\"Managers always take 360-degree feedback, and they go around the entire team and talk to the entire team to get a sense of what your work is like,\" she said. \"When you keep your team happy, you automatically keep your supervisor happy.\"\nShe also scheduled regular check-ins with her manager to get feedback, and she highlighted her aspirations, such as working with particular software, so that her manager could tap her when the opportunity came up.\nShe made about 900,000 Indian rupees, or about $10,700, annually.\nSoftware engineer\nVaidya was promoted to software engineer after two years.\nRelated stories\nShe said she followed female role models who reminded her to credit herself, not just the team.\nBeing vocal meant always discussing her next promotion and growth opportunity with managers. She made sure to document and communicate her successes.\n\"They knew that I was very invested in my career, and then my managers would really help me all around the year to get better projects,\" she said.\nIn this role, Vaidya was paid 1.2 million rupees, or about $14,200, annually.\nSenior software engineer and team lead\nAfter four years at the company, Vaidya was promoted to senior engineer, and she led a team of seven.\nAt the end of her projects, Vaidya found ways to demonstrate her work to leadership, such as sharing what she learned on the team's group chat, she said.\nShe also carefully filled out her annual appraisal documents, drafting them several times.\n\"I've seen that a lot of people don't take that very seriously, but it's something that goes into the system,\" she said. \"That's going to be taken into account every time you move up the ladder.\"\nIn this role, Vaidya was paid 2 million Indian rupees, or about $24,000, annually.\nShifting roles and US transfer\nAs she progressed, Vaidya felt pulled to product management. She used her free time during the pandemic to chart what a job with more business strategy could look like.\n\"I set up 15-minute sessions with about 200 people on LinkedIn to understand what this field was,\" she said. \"The more I talked to people, the more I realized it was something that I wanted to do.\"\nShe didn't think she had all the necessary skills, so she applied for master's courses specializing in product management in the US to better understand global work culture.\nBut when she tried to resign, Oracle \"didn't want to let me go,\" she said. Her job was critical to releasing a product, so the company offered her a product-management role in the US instead.\nShe negotiated a new salary with an eye toward the much higher cost of living in the US \u2014 even though Oracle was taking on significant costs, including for her visa.\n\"You can't let the excitement show in the conversations that you're having with your hiring managers,\" she said.\nTo gather salary data, Vaidya looked at Glassdoor and talked to people who'd made the move before.\n\"I was being given this offer for the credibility that I had built in the organization. I felt like I had an upper hand in negotiating,\" she said. \"I was much more confident in asking for the things that I deserve \u2014 so it ended up being a very smooth transition.\"\nAfter negotiating her base salary up to $80,000, she discussed other compensation components, including the timing of her next review, sign-on bonuses, relocation costs, paid leave, and remote work. She negotiated a sign-on bonus of $15,000 and a relocation allowance of $15,000, which weren't part of the initial offer.\n\"Everything under the sun is negotiable, and you just have to start with that mindset,\" she said.\nThe 2022 move took her to Redwood City, California, and she's now an artificial-intelligence product manager.\nShe has since moved to Seattle and plans to explore working in other US states.\nVaidya said she'd picked up two things from the work culture in the US: She'd been inspired to work on projects beyond her job, such as speaking at conferences and hosting tech podcasts, and she'd learned how to set better work-life boundaries.\nNow, her compensation is about $130,000 annually, including stock units and bonuses.
