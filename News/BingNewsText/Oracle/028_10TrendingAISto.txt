    "maintext": "In this article, we will take a detailed look at 10 Trending AI Stocks to Watch in December.\nJared Cohen, Goldman Sachs president of global affairs, co-head of the Goldman Sachs Global Institute, said while talking to CNBC in a latest program that amid rising data center-driven energy demand because of AI, the US would need to collaborate with other countries via \u201cdiplomacy.\u201d\n\u201cIf you look at data centers for cloud workloads versus data centers for AI workloads, data centers for AI workloads require ultra-high density. They need a concentrated power source, and so intermittent power like wind and solar doesn\u2019t fit the bill. You need base load power, so I think nuclear, coal, and natural gas are necessary, and we have plenty of that in the US. The problem is we can\u2019t transport it from where it is through multiple jurisdictions because of the \u2018not in my backyard\u2019 issue. So, the US is going to need some kind of overflow option if it wants to continue leading in this space. There\u2019s not a single geography that I would say represents a panacea to this problem.\u201d\nAnswering a question about whether the return to relatively cheaper and reliable energy sources like coal could satisfy the AI-driven energy demand, the analyst said the US would still need to look beyond just relying on its own sources because the need for power is huge.\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to have to probably bring another 35-plus gigawatts of power online relative to the 17 gigawatts of power that are already online feeding these data centers in just the next couple of years. That\u2019s not enough, that\u2019s not enough time. So, you know, the US is going to continue to lead in the space, but it\u2019s not going to be able to lead on its own.\u201d\nREAD ALSOJim Cramer\u2019s Latest Lightning Round: 11 Stocks to Watch and Jim Cramer on AMD and Other Stocks\nFor this article we picked 10 AI stocks that are getting investors\u2019 attention on the back of latest news. With each stock we have mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n10. Palantir Tech Inc (NYSE:PLTR)\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 43\nJeff McClean, CEO of Solidarity Wealth, said while talking to CNBC in a latest program that in the latest scenario of rising Ukraine-Russia tensions, Palantir Tech Inc (NYSE:PLTR) is at less risk when compared with other defense names. He also said Palantir Tech Inc (NYSE:PLTR) has become the new face of the defense industry in the US.\n\u201cJust because we have a Trump presidency doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that the world\u2019s going to become less dangerous, but I think it favors certain defense stocks over others. When you think of what Palantir has been doing the past year, I think they\u2019re going to be a favored defense stock compared to what we\u2019ve seen historically from the traditional powers. If you\u2019re looking at Lockheed Martin, they\u2019re probably more at risk from Elon Musk and Viv, who are pushing their Department of Governmental Efficiency and no-bid contracts that Lockheed Martin wins all the time. I think they\u2019re a bit more in danger than Palantir, which is the new face of defense.\u201d\nWhat makes Palantir Technologies Inc (NYSE:PLTR) one of the top AI stocks? Its technologies are actually solving the problems of businesses. Palantir\u2019s data technology Ontology is solving the famous hallucination problem for AI systems, thanks to the company\u2019s years of experience with military and defense systems. Earlier this year at an event with customers, Palantir Technologies Inc (NYSE:PLTR) shared some specifics on how its customers are being able to reduce costs and increase profits due to its artificial intelligence platform (AIP) that was launched about a year ago.\nAirbus accelerated A350 production by 33%, BP reduced costs per barrel by 60%, and Jacobs Connect cut power usage by 30%. Panasonic decreased waste by 12%, ESI Group sped up ERP harmonization by 70%, and PG&E reduced transformer ignitions by 65%. Eaton boosted productivity by 25%, while Tyson Foods achieved $200 million in cost savings.\n9. Dell Tech Inc (NYSE:DELL)\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 60\nDell Technologies (NYSE:DELL) was added to the Evercore ISI Tactical Outperform list ahead of its latest quarterly results, partly due to its exposure to artificial intelligence.\n\u201cDELL is well positioned to report upside to consensus October-quarter revenue and EPS estimates of $24.69B and $2.07, driven by strength in the ISG segment, including storage, general-purpose compute, and AI server strength,\u201d said Evercore analysts, led by Amit Daryanani, in a Wednesday note.\nEvercore also anticipates Dell Tech Inc (NYSE:DELL) will report AI server revenue exceeding $3.1B for the third quarter, with an AI server backlog between $3.5B and $4B.\n\u201cWhile an increase in AI server sales could dampen margin expectations, we believe a better storage environment will help DELL more than offset these headwinds,\u201d Daryanani added.\nDell posted mixed quarterly results with revenue missing expectations. What stands out is Dell\u2019s Infrastructure Solutions Group (ISG), which posted an impressive 34% year-over-year growth, reaching $11.4 billion in revenue. The server business rose a whopping 58% increase YoY to $7.4 billion.\nDell Tech Inc (NYSE:DELL) experienced a shift in AI server demand toward the next-generation Blackwell architecture. Dell Tech Inc (NYSE:DELL)\u2019s management highlighted that there was a dramatic shift in orders toward Nvidia\u2019s (NVDA) Blackwell-based systems during Q3, which impacted short-term shipments as these products ramp up production. This shift shows Dell Tech Inc (NYSE:DELL)\u2019s competitive position, as customers are willing to wait for the latest tech solutions. Dell secured $3.6 billion in AI server orders this quarter, an 11% increase from the previous quarter. Dell Tech Inc (NYSE:DELL) also signed over 2,000 enterprise customers for their AI solutions.\nCarillon Scout Mid Cap Fund stated the following regarding Dell Technologies Inc. (NYSE:DELL) in its Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\u201cDell Technologies Inc. (NYSE:DELL) was a top contributor despite reporting disappointing first-quarter earnings results, because investors looked through the near-term disappointment and expected strong growth from AI-related servers and personal computers. We expect Dell to participate in the growth of artificial intelligence hardware, especially as enterprises invest more aggressively. We like the company\u2019s depth and breadth of products and services, as well as its focus on keeping costs low.\u201d\n8. Intel Corp (NASDAQ:INTC)\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 68\nLast month, Bernstein\u2019s Stacy Rasgon, while talking to CNBC in a program ahead of Intel Corp (NASDAQ:INTC)\u2019s earnings, explained why he is worried about Intel shares:\n\u201cI mean, we\u2019ve got issues in the PC market. We\u2019ve got a CPU channel that\u2019s stuffed full in servers. Their competitors are still taking a good amount of share, and they don\u2019t really have any AI story to speak of to help make up the difference. Now, I\u2019m starting to get more and more worried about the trajectory for gross margins. They\u2019ve kind of been suggesting that as they ramp some of their new products, which actually have a lot more outsourced content, it hurts the margins. They\u2019ve been suggesting that may actually be an incremental headwind to margins as we get into next year. So, all that, and then you couple that with everything else around the process roadmap, burning cash, and everything else\u2014it doesn\u2019t feel like a good situation to be in. Clearly, they\u2019re in a tough spot.\u201d\nIn 2025, Intel Corp (NASDAQ:INTC) is expected to generate $4\u2013$5 billion in operating cash flow against a projected $20\u2013$23 billion in capital expenditures. Intel reported $5.1 billion in operating cash flow and spent $18.1 billion in the first nine months of this year.\nIntel bulls are linking their hopes with Intel Corp (NASDAQ:INTC)\u2019s foundry business. But the segment posted weak results in both the second and third quarters, with a third-quarter revenue drop of 8% and an EBIT loss that grew to $5.8 billion. Once seen as a potential competitor to Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM), Intel\u2019s steep third-quarter decline raised serious doubts about its manufacturing competitiveness.\nClearBridge Large Cap Value Strategy stated the following regarding Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) in its Q3 2024 investor letter:\n\u201cWhile the market environment clearly was a headwind in the third quarter, several of our large positions also faced challenging conditions, which negatively impacted results. In the information technology (IT) sector, Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) has come under additional pressure due to continued softness in the company\u2019s core PC and server markets as well as concerns on the company\u2019s longer-term competitive position. While Intel\u2019s turnaround is not happening overnight, we are constructive on the outlook into 2025: the company\u2019s product positioning should be much improved and it should be positioned to gain market share in a cyclical upswing in which it has strong earnings power. A somewhat adverse spending environment due to AI myopia has weighed on shares, but we still think the market is undershipping PCs and general servers following a COVID normalization period that saw demand get pulled ahead and then languish as companies froze IT budgets. The installed base is now getting older, and we expect a strong refresh cycle into next year. The delay is actually beneficial to Intel, whose product positioning will be all the more improved. While our investment case is not predicated on an M&A transaction, and we believe one is unlikely, the expression of interest in the company speaks to the value of the assets, which we think still trade at a meaningful discount to fair value.\u201d\n7. Oracle Corp (NYSE:ORCL)\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 91\nTalking about tech stocks he currently likes, Dan Niles of Niles Investment Management said in a recent program on CNBC that he likes Oracle Corp (NYSE:ORCL).\n\u201cWe like names like Oracle. We think next year it\u2019s going to be about networking all of this AI infrastructure together and helping enterprises get access to it.\u201d\nMadison Sustainable Equity Fund stated the following regarding Oracle Corporation (NYSE:ORCL) in its Q3 2024 investor letter:\n\u201cThe top contributors in the quarter were NextEra Energy, Oracle Corporation (NYSE:ORCL), Progressive Corporation, Equifax Inc., and United Healthcare. Oracle reported a strong first quarter with accelerating Cloud infrastructure demand. Oracle followed its solid first quarter with an upbeat analyst meeting which highlighted multi-year growth opportunities for the company.\u201d\nOracle Corp\u2019s (NYSE:ORCL) technology is critical for AI development, serving as a key foundation much like GPUs are for AI processes. Oracle says it has built large data centers with ultra-fast RDMA networks and massive 32,000-node NVIDIA GPU clusters, boosting its presence in AI training.\n6. Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA)\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 99\nDan Ives of Wedbush said while talking to Schwab Network in a latest program that Elon Musk\u2019s \u201cbet\u201d on Trump will change the entire landscape for his EV company.\n\u201cMusk betting on Trump is going to change the whole landscape for Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA), autonomous AI, and regulation. I think while that gets accelerated, EV tax credits will probably get pulled in January, which is negative for the industry and negative for Detroit. Remember, Musk, when it came to the Biden administration, even Obama, was on the outside looking in. Right now, the Trump administration has a huge seat at the table, and it\u2019s going to be very important when it comes to China tariffs. A lot of those discussions are almost like an AI ambassador. Look, I believe AI alone, the autonomous piece, is worth a trillion dollars alone for Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA).\u201d\nTesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) product lineup is showing signs of stagnation, with over 95% of sales still coming from the Model 3 and Model Y. Meanwhile, competitors are rolling out more advanced models. Even Rivian\u2019s CEO suggested Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) could be nearing market saturation for these models. According to Reuters, Tesla\u2019s market share in Europe is slipping as legacy automakers like BMW post stronger sales. Chinese competitor BYD is also gaining ground in Europe, despite talk of tariffs.\nThe Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) robotaxi event was short on details. Notably absent was the discussion of a \u201cmore affordable\u201d model that Musk had previously mentioned to boost confidence in Tesla\u2019s vehicle sales growth outlook.\nWhat about the $30,000 price tag claim?\nMusk has indicated that the Cybercab will have a production cost of approximately $30,000. Operating within the robotaxi fleet is projected to cost around $0.20 per mile. With a production cost of $30,000, the retail price of the Cybercab is likely to exceed this figure. For instance, if the Cybercab is priced at $30,000 per unit, that translates to $15,000 per seat. In contrast, the average price per passenger seat in Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA)\u2019s most affordable long-range RWD Model 3\u2014factoring in full self-driving (FSD) licensing\u2014is under $10,000 ($29,990 post-incentive vehicle price plus $8,000 for the FSD license, divided by four passenger seats). Regarding operational costs, while the Cybercab is expected to cost $0.20 per mile, charging the Model 3 is estimated at under $0.10 per mile, leaving a significant margin to cover maintenance and downtime.\nPolen Focus Growth Strategy stated the following regarding Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) in its Q3 2024 investor letter:\n\u201cThe largest relative detractors during the quarter were Apple, Airbnb, and Tesla (not owned). We\u2019ve spoken at length about our rationale for not owning Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA). In short, the market seems to be pricing in a lot of positive optionality for this company in the near-to-intermediate term (and particularly a fully autonomous fleet of electric vehicles in the medium term). What exists today is an automobile manufacturer limited to the higher-income segment that is increasingly challenged to sell vehicles when interest rates are not zero. We continue to question the company\u2019s long-term growth profile and governance.\u201d\n5. Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 158\nEarlier this month, Gene Munster from Deepwater Asset Management said while talking to CNBC that we are not going to see the impact of Apple AI on Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)\u2019s numbers until the next \u201cfew quarters.\u201d\nHe has revised his targets for growth but believes the stock has upside in the long term.\n\u201cI own it personally and think there\u2019s still some upside. I\u2019m always looking ahead, and I believe the numbers still have room to grow. However, one piece has changed. If you had asked me two weeks ago, I would\u2019ve said the Street expected iPhone growth around 15% for fiscal 2025. I\u2019ve revised that\u2014I now think it\u2019s closer to 10%. The Street is at 5%, so I still see upside, but not as much. I\u2019m also shifting some of that revenue into 2026, so this represents a slight change in my perspective.\u201d\nMadison Sustainable Equity Fund stated the following regarding Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in its Q3 2024 investor letter:\n\u201cAlphabet Inc., Eli Lilly and Company, Qualcomm Incorporated, Microsoft Corporation, and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) were the largest detractors. Apple has been volatile in the last quarter but ended on strength. Early in the quarter, Apple benefited from the introduction of their AI strategy, Apple Intelligence. They followed in September with the new iPhone 16, which also created some excitement. We are underweight to Apple, which has resulted in a headwind for performance.\u201d",
