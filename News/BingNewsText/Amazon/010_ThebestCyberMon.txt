    "maintext": "Amazon was the dark horse of this year's Cyber Weekend laptop deals, undercutting other tech retailers when it came to discounts on popular Apple MacBooks and Microsoft Surface devices. The gaming laptop deals it's still offering on Cyber Monday aren't quite as competitive as those you'll see at Best Buy, which has a better selection of models at a variety of price points. (That includes a $480 Lenovo LOQ, the cheapest gaming laptop of the past two days.) However, Amazon's options are still worth considering: I've looked them all up on the price-tracking site CamelCamelCamel, and most of them are sitting at record lows.\nRead on for a comprehensive list of Amazon's best Cyber Monday deals on gaming laptops \u2014 including an unprecedented discount on a variant of Mashable's current favorite budget machine.\nNote: Any deal marked with a \ud83d\udd25 has dropped to a record-low price.\nBest gaming laptop deal at Amazon\nWhy we like it\nRead Mashable's full review of the Acer Nitro V 15 (2023).\nFormer Mashable Tech Editor Kim Gedeon tested a $999.99 configuration of the Acer Nitro V 15 last year and rated it a 4.7/5, applauding its quiet keyboard, its sharp design \u2014 \"the perfect balance of fun and serious,\" she wrote \u2014 and its solid performance. (It ran well and stayed cool even while playing Cyberpunk 2077.) It's a Mashable Choice Award winner and our No. 1 gaming laptop under $1,000.\nMashable Deals\nWant more hand-picked deals from our shopping experts?\nSign up for the Mashable Deals newsletter.\nBy signing up you agree to our Terms of Use and Privacy Policy.\nThanks for signing up!\nThe model that Amazon has on sale as a Cyber Monday deal has a better CPU and GPU than our testing unit, the same amount of RAM, and half the storage. It's priced at $1,149.99 on Acer's website, which makes Amazon's listing a tad misleading: It's really $220 off, not $270 off. Still, $929.99 is a solid deal: That's the lowest price it's ever hit there since it was first listed in early fall.\nCyber Monday gaming laptop deals under $1,000\nAsus TUF Gaming A15 (AMD Ryzen 5 7535HS, Nvidia GeForce RTX 3050, 8GB RAM, 512GB SSD) \u2014 $649.99 $799.99 (save $150) \ud83d\udd25\nAsus TUF Gaming F16 (Intel Core i7-13650HX, Nvidia GeForce RTX 4060, 16GB RAM, 512GB SSD) \u2014 $999.99 $1,299.99 (save $300) \ud83d\udd25\nCyber Monday gaming laptop deals over $1,000\nAsus ROG Strix G16 (Intel Core i9-13650HX, Nvidia GeForce RTX 4060, 16GB RAM, 1TB SSD) \u2014 $1,099.99 $1,399.99 (save $300) \ud83d\udd25\nAsus TUF Gaming A16 (AMD Ryzen 9 7940HX, Nvidia GeForce RTX 4060, 16GB RAM, 512GB SSD) \u2014 $1,099.99 $1,399.99 (save $300) \ud83d\udd25\nAsus TUF Gaming A15 (AMD Ryzen 7 7940HS, Nvidia GeForce RTX 4070, 16GB RAM, 1TB SSD) \u2014 $1,199.99 $1,699.99 (save $500)\nDell G16 7630 (Intel Core i9-13900HX, Nvidia GeForce RTX 4070, 16GB RAM, 1TB SSD) \u2014 $1,299.99 $1,699.99 (save $400) \ud83d\udd25\nAsus TUF Gaming A16 (AMD Ryzen 9 7940HX, Nvidia GeForce RTX 4070, 16GB RAM, 1TB SSD) \u2014 $1,299.99 $1,799.99 (save $500) \ud83d\udd25\nAsus ROG Strix G16 (Intel Core i9-14900HX, Nvidia GeForce RTX 4070, 16GB RAM, 1TB SSD \u2014 $1,614.99 $1,899.99 (save $285)\nAlienware M18 (Intel Core i7-14700HX, Nvidia GeForce RTX 4070, 16GB RAM, 1TB SSD) \u2014 $1,699.99 $2,299.99 (save $600) \ud83d\udd25\nAlienware X16 R2 (Intel Core Ultra 7 155H, Nvidia GeForce RTX 4070, 16GB RAM, 1TB SSD) \u2014 $1,899.99 $2,399.99 (save $500) \ud83d\udd25",
