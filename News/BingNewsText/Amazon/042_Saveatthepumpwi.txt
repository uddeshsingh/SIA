Prime members can now access fuel discounts at thousands of gas stations across the U.S. According to Amazon, this new benefit could help members save up to $70 annually on fuel at participating locations.\nThis move brings Amazon Prime closer in line with Walmart+, which has been offering members gas discounts for several years.\nFind the best credit card for you by reviewing offers in our credit card marketplace or get personalized offers via CardMatch\u2122.\nAmazon Prime fuel savings offer\nAmazon Prime's new fuel savings offer allows members to save 10 cents per gallon when fueling up at around 7,000 BP, Amoco and AMPM locations across the U.S.\nIn 2025, Amazon plans to expand this benefit by adding a discount an electric vehicle charging discount with BP Pulse, BP's electric vehicle charging business.\nHow it works\nTo activate the fuel discount, visit amazon.com/fuelsavings to connect your Amazon account with Earnify, which is the loyalty program of BP and its subsidiaries.
