    "maintext": "Amazon Echo speakers come in all shapes, sizes and types, making these devices great for putting all around the house... or even the car. With so much flexibility for where you can use Alexa, it can be easy to slip up and place a speaker in an area that could end up disastrous for your smart speakers and smart displays.\nYou might know that putting your Alexa device near water isn't safe, but did you know that intruders can access your smart home device from outside if it's placed too close to a window? Damaging your Echo isn't the only risk factor at play here: You could be putting your privacy at risk as well.\nNot to worry because we have a helpful list of where you should avoid placing your Echo devices, and the best spots for them to go instead. (For more Amazon Echo tips, check out which Alexa settings you should change ASAP and five useful Echo features.)\n1. Keep Alexa away from your toilet\nPlacing an Echo near your toilet is gross. It's as simple as that.\nThink of all the germs that linger around that area, even in super-clean bathrooms. If you must have an Echo device in your bathroom (and we can see the appeal), try placing it as far away from the toilet as possible.\nIf you can, mount it on a wall with a sticky strip or a nail. Just make sure it's secure so it doesn't fall, and remember to place it near an outlet so you can plug it in. Also, keep it away from the bathtub. You wouldn't want to fry your Echo... or anything else.\n2. Avoid putting Alexa near a sink\nIf you're trying to drown out the sounds of Alexa's voice, by all means, place your expensive Echo by a sink. If you want to keep it intact, never place it anywhere near water.\nYou don't want to risk your kitchen water sprayer going haywire and soaking your Echo device, or a tall device getting tipped into the sink. Instead, place it on a different counter, like a kitchen island, or tuck it into a corner where it's farther from splattering spaghetti sauce and water spray. It'll stay cleaner and might sound better, too.\nRead more: The 7 Spots to Never Install a Home Security Camera\n3. Don't put Alexa by your windows\nKeep your Echo away from all the windows in your house. The location could potentially give anyone from the outside access to your Echo, and that could give access to your other smart home devices. For example, if your car is connected to your smart speaker, someone may be able to unlock and start it.\n4. Alexa shouldn't go under your TV\nHow many commercials are out there that say, \"Alexa, play\u2026\" and activate your Echo? Or if the TV says anything that sounds a lot like \"Alexa,\" take a guess at what's going to activate. Not only does this interrupt the show you're watching, but it also starts recording what's said after the command. If you're having a private conversation and Alexa kicks in, you're risking your privacy. Placing it on a side table makes more sense and is more likely to keep the voice assistant quiet until you make a command.\nIf you really want to place your Amazon Echo device close enough to the TV that it can hear it, then you might want to consider changing the wake word for the device. There are five total wake word options for Echo devices other than Alexa, so you'll have options that suit your home. There's even a way to access fun Disney content, too!\n5. Never put your Echo in front of a space heater\nYou should never expose your Amazon Echo to any heat sources, Amazon says. This includes space heaters, heater vents, radiators and stoves. Doing so could potentially cause a fire, or cause damage to your Echo device.\nInstead, make sure it's clearly placed away from the direction the heater is pointing to avoid a potential catastrophe. For instance, if you keep a space heater in your office, place the Echo on your desk and away from the heater.\nSo, where should you place your Amazon Echo?\nOn a mantle or shelf\nOn your bedside table\nMounted on a wall not facing a window\nIn the corner of your living room (away from windows)\nOn the edge of your kitchen counter far away from your sink\nA place easily visible so you can see when the light ring lights up\nYou can also read our story on the four best uses for your Amazon Echo device in each room of your home to help you decide where to place your Echo.\nReady for more tips on what to do with your Amazon Echo?
