    "maintext": "SHREVEPORT, La. (KSLA) - The Amazon Robotics Fulfillment Center in Shreveport marked its first Cyber Monday on Dec. 2.\nOfficials say Cyber Monday is the busiest online shopping day of the year, with millions of customers making purchases ahead of the holidays.\nKSLA\u2019s Donna Keeya toured the facility to see first-hand how the center handles orders during this busy time. She got a special behind-the-scenes tour of the facility.\nThe facility, called SHV1, is considered a \u201cfirst mile\u201d network, meaning it\u2019s the first place for someone\u2019s package in the flow of materials in the supply chain before it\u2019s taken to one of Amazon\u2019s \u201cmiddle mile\u201d centers. Then, a delivery service provider drops the packages off at people\u2019s homes/businesses.\n\u201cLike millions of shoppers across the country, more than likely you\u2019re online right now trying to grab some of those biggest deals. And you\u2019ll find them right here at Amazon.com,\u201d said Divina Mims, Amazon regional public relations manager.\n\u201cOn a normal day here at SHV1, we can move and process up to about half a million packages. At the height of peak, we\u2019re expected to nearly double that and process a million packages per day.\u201d\nAt SHV1, employees pick, pack and ship items like books, toys, housewares and electronics. The facility is five floors high and covers more than 2.5 million square feet. That\u2019s about the size of 50 football fields.\nOn a typical day, about a million items pass through the facility, which is the second of its kind of open in Louisiana in 2024.\nAmazon officials say Cyber Monday of 2023 was the single biggest shopping day in the company\u2019s history. Prime members bought more items that day than on any other day in the company\u2019s history. And sales from independent sellers (mostly small- and medium-size businesses) exceeded $1 billion on Cyber Monday of 2023.\nFor Cyber Monday last year, Amazon says some of the best-selling categories were home, fashion, toys, beauty and Amazon devices such as the Kindle. Specifically, the Echo Dot and Fire Stick TV were among the best sellers.\nThe company also says a significant number of purchases were made through the Amazon app, setting a new record for mobile shopping. And Amazon says it achieved its fastest delivery times for Cyber Monday orders, with many items delivered within hours of being purchased in some areas.\nAt SHV1, hiring continues on a rolling basis. Starting pay for employees at the facility is $18.50 per hour. In addition, most employees get access to benefits when they start, including healthcare, dental and vision coverage; a 401k with a 50% company match; and up to 20 weeks of paid parental leave.",
