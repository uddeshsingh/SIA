Karim Zreik will executive produce under his Cedar Tree Productions banner, with Ari Arad and EA\u2019s Michael Gamble also executive producing. Cedar Tree is currently under an overall deal at Amazon MGM Studios.\nExact plot details are being kept under wraps.\nIt was previously reported in 2021 that Amazon was in negotiations to develop a \u201cMass Effect\u201d TV series, but there have been no updates on the project until now. There had also been various attempts to develop a feature film based on the games but the project never materialized.\nThe first \u201cMass Effect\u201d game launched to rave reviews in 2007. Since then, there have been three more games in the main series, with \u201cMass Effect: Andromeda\u201d debuting in 2017. There have also been multiple mobile games in the franchise, as well as an animated film, novels, comic books, and other media.\nThe story of the first three \u201cMass Effect\u201d games revolves around Commander Shepard, a human soldier in the 22nd century trying to save humanity from a race of aliens known as the Reapers. \u201cAndromeda\u201d moved the games much further into the future with a new protagonist, with a fifth game also in the works.
