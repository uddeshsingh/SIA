    "maintext": "Amazon is shutting down Freevee, its free ad-supported streaming television (FAST) service, as it heightens focus on selling ads on its Prime Video subscription service.\nAmazon, which has owned IMDb since 1998, launched Freevee as IMDb Freedive in 2019. The service let people watch movies and shows, including Freevee originals, on demand without a subscription fee. Amazon's streaming offering was also previously known as IMDb TV and rebranded to Amazon Freevee in 2022.\nAccording to a report from Deadline this week, Freevee is being \u201cphased out over the coming weeks,\u201d but a firm closing date hasn\u2019t been shared publicly.\nExplaining the move to Deadline, an Amazon spokesperson said:\nTo deliver a simpler viewing experience for customers, we have decided to phase out Freevee branding. There will be no change to the content available for Prime members, and a vast offering of free streaming content will still be accessible for non-Prime members, including select Originals from Amazon MGM Studios, a variety of licensed movies and series, and a broad library of FAST Channels \u2013 all available on Prime Video.\nThe shutdown also means that producers can no longer pitch shows to Freevee as Freevee originals, and \u201cany pending deals for such projects have been cancelled,\u201d Deadline reported.\nFreevee shows still available for free\nFreevee original shows include Jury Duty, with James Marsden, Judy Justice, with Judge Judy Sheindlin, and Bosch: Legacy, a continuation of the Prime Video original series Bosch. The Freevee originals are expected to be available to watch on Prime Video after Freevee closes. People won't need a Prime Video or Prime subscription in order to watch these shows. As of this writing, I was also able to play some Freevee original movies without logging in to a Prime Video or Prime account. Prime Video has also made some Prime Video originals, like The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power, available under a \u201cFreevee\u201d section in Prime Video where people can watch for free if they log in to an Amazon (Prime Video or Prime subscriptions not required) account. Before this week's announcement, Prime Video and Freevee were already sharing some content.\nBloomberg reported this week that some Freevee shows will remain free to watch \u201cdue to contractual prohibitions.\u201d It\u2019s unclear what might happen to such Freevee original content after said contractual obligations conclude.\nFreevee became redundant, confusing\nAmazon's FAST service seemed redundant after Amazon launched the Prime Video ad tier in January. With the subscription tier making money from subscription fees and ads shown on Prime Video with ads, it made little sense for Amazon to continue with Freevee, which only has the latter revenue stream.\nPushing people from streaming off of Freevee to Prime Video could help Amazon attract people to Prime Video or Amazon's e-commerce site and simplify tracking what people are streaming. Meanwhile, Amazon plans to show more ads on Prime Video in 2025 than it did this year.\nTwo anonymous sources told advertising trade publication Adweek in February that the two services were confusing subscribers and ad buyers. At the time, the publication claimed that Amazon was \u201claying the groundwork\" to kill Freevee \"for months.\u201d It cited two anonymous \u201cpeople familiar with the matter\u201d who pointed to moves like Amazon shifting Freevee technical workers to work on the Prime Video ads infrastructure and Amazon laying off Freevee marketing and strategy employees. In February, Amazon denied that it was ending Freevee, saying it was \"an important streaming offering providing both Prime and non-Prime customers thousands of hit movies, shows, and originals, all for free,\u201d per Adweek.\nFreevee\u2019s demise comes as streaming providers try navigating a booming market where profits remain elusive, and ad businesses are still developing. Some industry stakeholders and analysts are expecting more consolidation in the streaming industry as competition intensifies and streamers get increasingly picky about constantly rising subscription fees.\nThe end of Freevee also marks another product in the Amazon graveyard. Other products that Amazon has killed since 2023 include Astro for Business robots, Amazon Halo fitness trackers, the Alexa Built-in smartphone app, and the Amazon Drive file storage service.",
