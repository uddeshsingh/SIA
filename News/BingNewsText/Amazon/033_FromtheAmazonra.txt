    "maintext": "MANAUS, Brazil (AP) \u2014 Speaking from the Amazon rainforest, President Joe Biden declared Sunday that there\u2019s no going back in America\u2019s \u201cclean energy revolution\u201d even as the incoming Trump administration vows to spur fossil fuel production and scale back efforts against climate change.\nBiden, the first sitting U.S. president to visit the world\u2019s largest tropical rainforest, saw up close the ravages of deforestation. The Amazon, which is about the size of Australia, stores huge amounts of the world\u2019s carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas driving climate change. But development is rapidly depleting the long-verdant region, where rivers have been running dry.\nFlanked by giant ferns in the forest, Biden said the fight against climate change has been a defining cause of his presidency \u2014 he\u2019s pushed for cleaner air, water and energy and achieved legislation that steered unprecedented federal spending to the fight against global warming.\nBut he\u2019s about to hand off to Republican President-elect Donald Trump, who is highly unlikely to prioritize the Amazon or anything related to climate change, which he\u2019s cast as a \u201choax.\u201d\nTrump has pledged to again pull out of the Paris agreement, a global pact forged to avert the threat of catastrophic climate change, and he says he\u2019ll rescind unspent money in energy efficiency legislation.\n\u201cIt\u2019s true, some may seek to deny or delay the clean energy revolution that\u2019s underway in America,\u201d Biden said from a podium set up on a sandy forest bed. \u201cBut nobody, nobody can reverse it, nobody \u2014 not when so many people, regardless of party or politics, are enjoying its benefits.\u201d\nThe question now, he said, is \u201cwhich government will stand in the way and which will seize the enormous opportunity.\u201d\nHis trip comes as the U.N. climate conference is underway in Azerbaijan. Brazil will hold the talks next year.\nDuring a helicopter tour, Biden saw severe erosion, ships grounded in one of the Amazon River\u2019s main tributaries and fire damage. He also passed over a wildlife refuge for endangered species of monkeys and birds and the expansive waters where the Negro River tributary flows into the Amazon. He was joined by Carlos Nobre, a Nobel Prize-winning scientist and expert on how climate change is harming the Amazon.\nBiden met Indigenous leaders \u2014 introducing his daughter and granddaughter \u2014 and visited a museum at the gateway to the Amazon where Indigenous women shook maracas as apart of a welcoming ceremony. He then signed a U.S. proclamation designating Nov. 17 as International Conservation Day.\nThe U.S. president leaned into the symbolism of his trip, saying the Amazon might be the \u201clungs of the world,\u201d but \u201cin my view, our forest and national wonders are the heart and soul of the world. They unite us. They inspire us to make us proud of our countries and our heritage.\u201d\nThe Amazon is home to Indigenous communities and 10% of Earth\u2019s biodiversity. About two-thirds of the Amazon lies within Brazil. Scientists say its devastation poses a catastrophic threat to the planet.\nDuring brief remarks from the forest, Biden sought to highlight his commitment to the preservation of the region. He said the U.S. was on track to reach $11 billion in spending on international climate financing in 2024, a sixfold increase from when he started his term. Poorer nations struggling with rising seas and other effects of climate change say the U.S. and other wealthier nations have yet to fulfill their pledges to help.\n\u201cThe fight to protect our planet is literally a fight for humanity,\u201d he said.\nBiden\u2019s administration announced plans last year for a $500 million contribution to the Amazon Fund, the most significant international cooperation effort to preserve the rainforest, primarily financed by Norway.\nThe U.S. has said it has provided $50 million, and the White House announced Sunday an additional $50 million contribution.\nBiden\u2019s trip was significant, but \u201cwe can\u2019t expect concrete results from this visit,\u201d said Suely Ara\u00fajo, former head of the Brazilian environmental protection agency and public policy coordinator with the nonprofit Climate Observatory.\nShe doubts that a \u201csingle penny\u201d will go to the Amazon Fund once Trump is in the White House.\nThe Biden administration touted a series of new efforts aimed at bolstering the Amazon and stemming the impact of climate change.\nThat includes the launch of a finance coalition looking to spur at least $10 billion in public and private investment for land restoration and eco-friendly economic projects by 2030 as well as a $37.5 million loan to support the large-scale planting of native tree species on degraded grasslands in Brazil.\nThe Amazon has been suffering under two years of historic drought that have dried up waterways, isolated thousands of river communities and hindered riverine dwellers\u2019 ability to fish. It\u2019s also made way for wildfires that have burned an area larger than Switzerland and choked cities near and far with smoke.\nWhen Brazilian President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva took office last year, he signaled a shift in environmental policy from his far-right predecessor, Jair Bolsonaro.\nLula has pledged \u201czero deforestation\u201d by 2030, though his term runs through 2026. Forest loss in Brazil\u2019s Amazon dropped by 30.6% in the 12 months through July from a year earlier, bringing deforestation to its lowest level in nine years, official data released last week said.\nIn that 12-month span, the Amazon lost 6,288 square kilometers (2,428 square miles), roughly the size of the U.S. state of Delaware. But that data fails to capture the surge of destruction this year, which will only be included in next year\u2019s reading.\nDespite the success in curbing Amazon deforestation, Lula\u2019s government has been criticized by environmentalists for backing projects that could harm the region, such as paving a highway that cuts from an old-growth area and could encourage logging, oil drilling near the mouth of the Amazon River and building a railway to transport soy to Amazonian ports.\nWhile Biden is the first sitting president in the Amazon, former President Theodore Roosevelt traveled to the region with the help of the American Museum of Natural History following his 1912 loss to Woodrow Wilson. Roosevelt, joined by his son and naturalists, traversed roughly 15,000 miles, and the former president fell ill with malaria and suffered a serious leg infection after a boat accident.\nBiden is making the Amazon visit as part of a six-day trip to South America, the first to the continent of his presidency. He traveled from Lima, Peru, where he took part in the annual Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit and met with Chinese President Xi Jinping.\nAfter his stop in Manaus, he was heading to Rio de Janeiro for this year\u2019s Group of 20 leaders summit.\n___\nSa Pessoa reported from Sao Paulo, and Long from Washington.",
