U.K. streaming bundles\nCyber Monday deals are here, and they're bringing massive savings on streaming services! Major platforms like Max, Disney Plus, Hulu, Peacock and more are offering incredible discounts. But most of these streaming deals won't be available tomorrow \u2014 so you need to act fast!\nAs Tom's Guide\u2019s streaming editor, I spend all year helping people find the best shows and movies to watch on the top streaming services. And trust me, these deals make it easier than ever to enjoy top-tier content without breaking the bank \u2014 especially with these unbeatable Cyber Monday savings.\nThe best streaming deal I've seen so far (and ever) is Hulu's 12-month subscription for just $1 per month. No, it's not a mistake, it really is just 99 cents a month. That's a massive 90% price drop, and it ends today, so you'd better be quick!\nThere are some good bundle deals out there as well at the moment, including Hulu and Disney Plus for $3 per month. That's a solid 72% discount that also ends today. Our favorite streamer has also cut its prices for Cyber Monday \u2014 Max is now just $3 per month for six months. That offer goes away when Cyber Monday ends, too.\nThere are some great deals in the UK as well. You can get 6-month sports plans on Now with \u00a353 off full price, so that you can finish off the Premier League season or the last few F1 races. You can also get NowTV's Entertainment package for just \u00a36, as well as ITV X's \u00a32 deal.\nFor a device to stream all of that content, the Roku Express is currently $24 at Amazon.
