    "maintext": "Pick up a basic budget-friendly device at an even lower price with these Amazon Fire tablet deals. The retailer-owned devices are regularly reduced throughout the year and during major events so there's always a good chance to bag a saving. We've gathered all the latest deals so you never miss out.\nIf you're looking to browse the web, catch up on some media streaming, play some simple games, keep the youngsters entertained with one of the bespoke Kids versions, or simply grab one of the best cheap tablets for an alternative to the Kindle ereader, a device in the Amazon Fire range is the ultimate affordable buy.\nOne thing to point out is that this year's Black Friday deals are going live throughout the month so there should be a handful of best-ever deals across Amazon's range of tablets in the weeks ahead.\nYou can also look through the other tablet deals and iPad deals available today for some alternative options with more power or ones that aren't locked into the Amazon ecosystem. For those just after something for books, you'll want to head over to check out the latest Kindle deals.\nAmazon Fire deals\nSince its launch, the Amazon Fire tablet range has expanded to include six models with different screen sizes, display qualities and performance capabilities. The result is a selection of devices that cover all sorts of needs: whether you just need a basic tablet for web browsing and video streaming or a more capable device for some light work, gaming and more.\nThings start with the Fire 7 tablet - the ultimate budget buy that's been as low as $40 / \u00a340 in the past. The 7-inch display means it's compact and easy to hold in one hand for media consumption.\nThe Fire HD 8 is the ideal middle-of-the-road option as it's still relatively cheap at $99.99 / \u00a399.99 but offers a larger 8-inch display and a 30% performance upgrade over the previous model. The Fire HD 8 Plus take this one step further, with more RAM and a convenient wireless charging option for $119.99 / \u00a3159.99.\nAfter that is the Fire HD 10, which boasts a 10.1-inch screen and a faster octa-core processor if you want to eke out more performance for $149.99 / \u00a3199.99. There's also a Fire HD 10 Plus version with more RAM for improved multitasking and wireless charging support for $179.99 / \u00a3189.99.\nAnd then last up is the latest Fire 11 Max with its 11-inch display, powerful performance, solid 14-hour battery life and decent storage options of 64GB or 128GB from $229.99 / \u00a3249.99.\nAmazon Fire Kids deals\nGot tech-hungry children? The Amazon Fire Kids Edition tablet is a smart option for any aged around 3 - 7 years old.\nIt comes encased in an eye-catching and durable protective casing, but if that wasn't enough, it has a two-year unrestricted guarantee. So, if it gets broken or damaged accidentally then Amazon will replace it no questions asked. It's also equipped with plenty of software safeguards so you can ensure they only access appropriate content and set screen-time limits.\nThree different options are available in a range of screen sizes: seven inches, eight inches and ten inches.\nThe Fire 7 Kids is the most basic model that's best suited to the very young with a recommended price of $129.99 / \u00a3114.99.\nThe Fire HD 8 Kids offers upgrades to audio, storage and battery life, though that does increase the cost to $149.99 / \u00a3149.99.\nLastly, the Fire HD 10 Kids is the most expensive of the lot at $199.99 / \u00a3209.99 but offers performance upgrades and the biggest display for those after the best browsing, streaming and gaming experience.\nAds or no ads?\nIf you're browsing through these Amazon Fire tablet deals and noticing some cost differences, it's because Amazon offers two tiers of pricing based on whether or not you accept ads.\nIf you opt for the cheaper ad-supported model you'll see Amazon's special offers on the device's lock screen. It's important to note that this does not affect the way individual apps serve you advertisements, so you'll still see ads in these apps or when using a web browser if you grab the more expensive device.\nHowever, if you do pick up the cheaper model and regret your decision, you can pay the difference to have those lock screen offers removed as well. That makes it better to trial with the ad-supported tablet and pay more further down the line if it's particularly annoying.\nMost importantly, though, this doesn't apply to any of the Kids tablets - these do not show ads on the lock screen.",
