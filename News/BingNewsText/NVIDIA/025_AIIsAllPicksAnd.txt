    "maintext": "Nvidia has become a household word these days. As a holder since 2015, I have experienced the growth stages of the stock\u2014along with the sell offs\u2014for almost ten years. Some of those stages were short lived\u2014like the crypto mining rush and the gaming rush. Today\u2019s almost universal worshipping of the company has a very different tone though. There are few investors taking the other side of this trade. Here are some of my concerns:\nCircus-like atmosphere around NVDA\u2019s earnings announcements: Countdown clocks, near continuous coverage the day before earnings, and general analysts\u2019 positive coverage of NVDA are all at the highest possible level.\nEntire nuclear power plants dedicated to AI only. Am I the only one that thinks this is excessive? For example, Google will use nuclear reactors to power its AI centers\u2014for what? To have a more analytic answer to \u201cwould you like fries with that?\u201d So far, we can only speculate on the benefits.\nCEO Jensen Huang\u2019s growing media halo: The media has crowned him the \u201cGodfather of AI\u201d with Nvdia\u2019s \u201cflawless\u201d earnings results. I bet Jensen Huang never expected the company he founded would end up being at the center of the AI universe. I have watched this engineer evolve to a philosopher to keep up with the public\u2019s strong interest in AI. Quotes like \u201cWe are at the beginning of a new industrial revolution\u201d are untypically sweeping for a CEO of a publicly traded company.\nTypical healthy skepticism is gone: For the past eight years I was on the positive side of NVDA, and there were lots of skeptics. There were plenty of \u201csell\u201d recommendations. Current professional coverage\u2014as well as general media\u2014is uniquely polarized in one direction: Extremely positive. A daily search of the news headlines for NVDA produces phrases like \u201cstrong buy.\u201d \u201cblowout,\u201d \u201cthe world runs on Nvidia,\u201d \u201cremains strong\u201d and even \u201csafe haven.\u201d There appears to be no healthy skeptics.\nInvestors are blind to valuation sleight of hand. Any investment can be made to appear cheap on a forward price/earnings (P/E), price/sales (P/S) or P/E to growth rate: just inflate the forward sales or earnings expectations. When this bubble starts to show signs of fatigue, forward sales will start to drop as they should.\nScant attention/understanding regarding AI: Billions of dollars have already been spent on an AI buildout, and many more dollars will be spent. All CEO\u2019s struggle to articulate why they are investing, however. When asked about specific examples of how AI will improve results, they don\u2019t have concrete answers. Typical answers are variations of \u201cour competitors are spending, so we need to keep up with them.\u201d\nThis last point troubles me the most. Why are investors so enchanted by AI?\nAI has seduced investors, companies and curious onlookers with its potential to reshape industries. From IBM\u2019s Watson to ChatGPT\u2019s ability to mimic human conversation, we\u2019ve come a long way in \u201cnarrow AI\u201d advancements. These narrow successes pave the way for dreams of \u201cgeneral AI\u201d\u2014a system that truly mimics human intelligence. But the road from wishful innovation to transformative reality has yet to be constructed. We should expect AI advances to show up in repetitive tasks, call centers and other low-level functions. But we should be careful thinking that AI will advance beyond that.\nWhy is that? Despite its early wins, AI still trails behind in the simplest of human tasks. It can play chess, write college admissions essays and solve complicated equations but ask it to play charades or navigate a tumbleweed on the highway and you\u2019ll be very disappointed. Computers excel in training and processing unimaginable amounts of data. But intelligence that rivals the human brain\u2014running on 0.3 kWh and the size of two fists\u2014is still a distant dream. Investors have largely ignored this observation. While \u201cbreakthroughs\u201d dominate headlines, the underlying theoretical progress remains slow. Theorists are leading the way, questioning fundamental approaches, while experimentalists\u2014the coders\u2014tinker with existing frameworks. But you can\u2019t invest in theorists. Investors have worked around this by identifying other ways to invest.\nLast year, two paths emerged: bet on the builders (companies creating AI products) or the suppliers (the \u201cpick and shovel\u201d providers). Mark Twain famously quipped, \u201cWhen everyone is looking for gold, it\u2019s a good time to be in the pick and shovel business.\u201d Nvidia, as a supplier of GPUs, has become a cornerstone of AI infrastructure. So far with Big Tech spending at an all-time high\u2014fueled by a fear of being left behind\u2014the pick-and-shovel approach has been paying dividends. But I don\u2019t think this trend can continue indefinitely.\nAt its core, AI today is more artificial than intelligent. While the technology marches forward, human common sense\u2014embedded in our brains, shaped by bodies and honed through experience\u2014remains far out of reach. The AI gold rush may continue for now, but savvy investors will look beyond the glitter to the tools fueling the frenzy.\nHere are two early warning signals I have used to as AI sell triggers:\nThe Better Mousetrap: The emergence of disruptive technologies like DeepSouth AI could be better solutions. This is little-followed Australian company is using off-the-shelf components to create brain-inspired systems (neuromorphic computing) that are dramatically more efficient\u2014and much cheaper.\nThe Great Enlightenment: CEOs may be waking up to the reality that overinvestment in AI, without a clear payoff, is unsustainable.\nDeepSouth and other inventions might be that better mousetrap. Yet hardly anyone is considering this possibility. If DeepSouth\u2019s pending demonstration is successful it could shift all business away from Nvidia in a short time. It could transform the entire industry and produce many casualties. Regarding the Great Enlightenment, a few analysts are beginning to ask about the buildout and timing of possible dividends. So I think the dawn of the Grate Enlightenment\u2014that forces a reevaluation of today\u2019s runaway spending\u2014has begun. AI-related stocks are riding high, but a large selloff could be on the horizon as the Great Enlightenment and Better Mousetrap gain momentum.\nWhile riding the AI wave has been exciting and profitable, it may be time to consider stepping off the surfboard.\nDisclosure: Andersen Capital owns the referenced stocks in this article.
