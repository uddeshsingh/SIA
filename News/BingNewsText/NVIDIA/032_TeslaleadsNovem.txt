Similarly, Visa saw its market value increase by 8.3% to $617.5 billion, as resilient consumer spending pushed it to a strong fourth-quarter profit.\nReports that U.S. authorities ordered Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company 2330.TW to halt shipments of advanced chips to China, a move aimed at curbing exports of critical technologies, helped wipe 5.1% off its market cap, which fell to $793.5 billion.\nAI bellwether Nvidia's NVDA.O market value rose by a modest 3.9%, slowing from October's 9.3% increase as its revenue growth forecast failed to excite investors.\nReporting By Patturaja Murugaboopathy and Gaurav Dogra in Bengaluru; Editing by Kirsten Donovan",
