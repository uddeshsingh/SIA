    "maintext": "In a blow to Intel\u2018s turnaround plans, CEO Pat Gelsinger has resigned from the big chip maker without a permanent successor in place.\nGelsinger spent more than 40 years at the company, rising through the ranks as an engineer. He seemed like the perfect CEO when he was appointed. But his tenure with marked with failed execution that he had vowed to fix. Intel\u2019s stock was down 52% this year before the announcement. In trading today, Intel\u2019s stock is up 3.31% to $24.84 a share.\nGelsinger is retiring effective immediately, and he will be replaced on an interim basis by David Zinsner and Michelle Johnston Holthaus as co-CEOs. Zinsner is the CFO of Intel, while Holthaus is the general manager of Intel\u2019s client computing group.\nHolthaus will also serve in the newly created job of CEO of Intel Products, which includes Intel\u2019s consumer business as well as its data center, AI, network, and edge businesses.\nFrank Yeary, an independent board member and chairman of the board of Intel, will become interim executive chair during the transition period. The board has formed a search committee and will work to find a permanent successor to Gelsinger.\n\u201cLeading Intel has been the honor of my lifetime \u2013 this group of people is among the best and the brightest in the business, and I\u2019m honored to call each and every one a colleague,\u201d said Gelsinger, in a statement. \u201cToday is, of course, bittersweet as this company has been my life for the bulk of my working career. I can look back with pride at all that we have accomplished together. It has been a challenging year for all of us as we have made tough but necessary decisions to position Intel for the current market dynamics. I am forever grateful for the many colleagues around the world who I have worked with as part of the Intel family.\u201d\nRich history\nGelsinger joined Intel in 1979 when he was 18 and he became the lead architect of Intel\u2019s highly successful 80486 processor, which debuted in 1989. At age 32, he was named as a vice president \u2014 the youngest VP in the company\u2019s storied history. He was named CTO in 2001 and often delivered keynote speeches at Intel\u2019s developer forum. He seemed born to be CEO, but was passed over.\nIn 2009, he left Intel to join EMC as president, and he was appointed CEO of VMware in 2012. He rejoined Intel in 2021 after the chipmaker had run off course during the tenure of Brian Krzanich. CFO Bob Swan briefly replaced Krzanich and then Gelsinger took his place.\nIntel was a vaunted chipmaker throughout its history, but it fell behind Taiwan\u2019s TSMC in leading technology and Advanced Micro Devices made a comeback with its Zen designers for microprocessors.\nWhile Intel held onto the leading market share position, AMD steadily grew its market share in key data center and high-end computing markets with its multi-generational success of its Zen architecture. Nvidia also took the lead in AI and graphics chips and Intel never caught up.\nUpon coming back as CEO, Gelsinger had vowed to fix the manufacturing problems that arose during Krzanich\u2019s tenure. He invested billions of dollars in chip manufacturing technology and was instrumental in getting Intel grants from the U.S. federal government in the wake of the passage of the Chips & Science Act. That money is earmarked for U.S. manufacturing plants, in the hopes of creating high-value manufacturing jobs and restoring the nation\u2019s technology independence.\nGelsinger also chose to build so much capacity that Intel would manufacture chips for other companies, not just chips designed by Intel engineers. His leadership return was popular at first as it seemed like Intel had gotten away from its manufacturing roots during the growth of the electronics age.\nIn 1971, Intel launched the first commercially successful microprocessor, a chip with most of the components for computing processing on a single chip. It had just 2,300 transistors. But thanks to Moore\u2019s Law (formulated by former Intel CEO Gordon Moore in 1965) and technological improvements, the number of components on a chip kept doubling every couple of years. Now Intel processors have more than 10 billion transistors.\nBut the renewed Intel Foundry business, as Gelsinger called it, was slow to prove its worth and get off the ground. In August, Intel said it would lay off more than 15% of its workforce, or less than 15,000 people. Intel is still a valuable company valued at $107.2 billion, but AMD has raced ahead under the leadership of CEO Lisa Su at $227.6 billion and Nvidia is valued at $3.395 trillion.\nI did an interview with Gelsinger back in February and talked with him about the vast opportunity he saw to become the AI chipmaker to fuel the growth of the AI era of computing. He wanted to distinguish Intel with IDM 2.0, a strategy that refers to \u201cintegrated device manufacturer\u201d where Intel both designs chips and makes them too. Most other chip makers can\u2019t afford factories and have chosen to farm out the manufacturing to the likes of TSMC and Samsung.\nGelsinger told me, \u201cTo a great degree, Intel has been a manufacturer forever. I talked about IDM 1.0. As we announced our IDM 2.0 strategy a little over two years ago, it was really becoming a world-class fabless company and a world-class foundry. The unique ability we had to create more scale and efficiency by being a foundry for the industry. Obviously the AI surge created this moment in time where\u2013what I call our advanced packaging is a capability that Intel has been a leader in forever. With that now, these advanced AI components need advanced packaging. It\u2019s been a tail wind for our move into foundry.\u201d\nInterim successors\nZinsner has more than 25 years of financial and operational experience in semiconductors, manufacturing and the technology industry. He joined Intel in January 2022 from Micron Technology, where he was executive vice president and CFO. Zinsner served in a variety of other leadership roles earlier in his career, including president and chief operating officer at Affirmed Networks and senior vice president of finance and CFO at Analog Devices.\nHolthaus is a proven general manager and leader who began her career with Intel nearly three decades ago. Prior to being named CEO of Intel Products, she was executive vice president and general manager of CCG. Holthaus has held a variety of management and leadership roles at Intel, including chief revenue officer and general manager of the Sales and Marketing Group, and lead of global CCG sales.\nZinsner and Holthaus said in a statement, \u201cWe are grateful for Pat\u2019s commitment to Intel over these many years as well as his leadership. We will redouble our commitment to Intel Products and meeting customer needs. With our product and process leadership progressing, we will be focused on driving returns on foundry investments.\u201d\nChairman\u2019s statement\nIn a statement, the new chairman Yeary said, \u201cOn behalf of the board, I want to thank Pat for his many years of service and dedication to Intel across a long career in technology leadership. Pat spent his formative years at Intel, then returned at a critical time for the company in 2021. As a leader, Pat helped launch and revitalize process manufacturing by investing in state-of-the-art semiconductor manufacturing, while working tirelessly to drive innovation throughout the company.\u201d\nYeary added, \u201cWhile we have made significant progress in regaining manufacturing competitiveness and building the capabilities to be a world-class foundry, we know that we have much more work to do at the company and are committed to restoring investor confidence. As a board, we know first and foremost that we must put our product group at the center of all we do. Our customers demand this from us, and we will deliver for them. With MJ\u2019s permanent elevation to CEO of Intel Products along with her interim co-CEO role of Intel, we are ensuring the product group will have the resources needed to deliver for our customers. Ultimately, returning to process leadership is central to product leadership, and we will remain focused on that mission while driving greater efficiency and improved profitability.\u201d\nYeary concluded, \u201cWith Dave and MJ\u2019s leadership, we will continue to act with urgency on our priorities: simplifying and strengthening our product portfolio and advancing our manufacturing and foundry capabilities while optimizing our operating expenses and capital. We are working to create a leaner, simpler, more agile Intel.\u201d\nPatrick Moorhead, CEO of Moor Insights & Strategy, said in a message to Venturebeat that Gelsinger walked into a \u201cvery difficult scenario.\u201d\n\u201cThe company was three years behind in process tech and two years behind and design. To say that it was a turnaround is an understatement,\u201d he said. \u201cIntel accomplished a lot under his tenure. I believe that 18A (process node) will be a competitive node. All designs have moved from monolithic to chiplets.\u201d\nMoorhead added, \u201cWith Gaudi Intel did create a competitive part, but the hyperscalers ended up building their own ASICs (custom chips). But Intel missed was data center graphics processing units (GPUs). AMD made the transition very quickly from high flops to low precision tops. Big picture, Pat tried to accomplish in retrospect too many things at the same time. He accomplished a lot, but things were missed at the same time.\u201d\nKevin Krewell, an analyst for Tirias Research, said in a message that he believed in Gelsinger\u2019s factory strategy and wished they had given him another year.\n\u201cIf the board has lost patience with Pat\u2019s plan, it will be up to his replacement to chart a new path. I believe it\u2019s premature to try to spin off the fabs as a foundry before Intel has established the 18A process,\u201d Krewell said. \u201cIn addition, it\u2019s been widely reported that the Chips & Science Act monies are predicated on Intel maintaining over 50% ownership of the fabs. That\u2019s too much money to pass on.\u201d\nKrewell said he expects additional cuts will be instituted to improve the financials. There will also need a full product and personnel review once the company decides the path forward.\n\u201cConsidering the regulatory environment worldwide, I don\u2019t think selling the company will work either,\u201d he said. \u201cBut Intel is critical to U.S. competition and it needs to get back on its feet.\u201d",
