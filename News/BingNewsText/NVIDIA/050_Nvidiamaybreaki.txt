    "maintext": "By Emily Bary\nNvidia's outlook for the January quarter may not wow Wall Street when the company posts earnings next week. But Mizuho analysts see bright prospects for later next year.\nNvidia Corp. has been a poster child for spectacular beat-and-raise quarters recently, but will that take a pause when the company posts results next Wednesday?\nPerhaps, according to an analyst, but then Nvidia (NVDA) could get back to its old ways.\nWhile Nvidia is known for giving upbeat guidance, Mizuho's Vijay Rakesh thinks the company's outlook for the January quarter might more or less just match what analysts are expecting. His new January-quarter revenue forecast is for $36.7 billion, while the FactSet consensus view is for $36.6 billion. Rakesh said the consensus elsewhere is even with his estimate at $36.7 billion.\nRakesh noted that buy-side investors are likely expecting revenue guidance ranging from $36 billion to $39 billion.\nFactSet shows that Nvidia has beaten expectations with its quarterly sales guidance in each of its past seven reports. The company delivered its smallest beat of that stretch, however, following the most recent report.\nRead: Nvidia's stock is up 200% this year. Why analysts say it still screams 'buy.'\nRakesh's projection for an in-line January-quarter forecast relates to the timing of Nvidia's new Blackwell chip. He thinks that ramp will take place toward the end of the January quarter, limiting the upside that Blackwell graphics processing units and systems can offer.\nBut Mizuho desk-based analyst Jordan Klein went on to detail the rosy expectations that Nvidia investors have for 2025, which loosely corresponds to Nvidia's 2026 fiscal year, which begins in February. Business growth is expected to accelerate in the second half of the fiscal year, \"fueled by massive orders and pent-up demand for Blackwell as [Nvidia's] supply chain is able to [manufacture] and ship the full-rack NVL72 systems in true volumes,\" according to Klein.\nInvestors are \"SUPER LONG\" Nvidia shares on the potential for accelerating beats and raises later in the year, Klein said.\n\"Everyone wants to be long and strong into that ramp,\" Klein noted. Investors also seem like they want to be on board for talk of Nvidia's next-generation Rubin chip and \"likely much more ethernet-based networking\" when Nvidia Chief Executive Jensen Huang takes the stage in March for the company's annual GTC event, he added.\nMeanwhile, Citi analyst Christopher Danely called artificial intelligence \"the bright spot\" in the semiconductor sector as areas like industrial and automotive chips continue to face challenges. Citi now expects that U.S. cloud-service providers will spend $166 billion on capital expenditures this year, up from a prior estimate of $155 billion. That bodes well for Nvidia and other AI chip plays, according to Danely.\nSee also: Nvidia slips a spot among top S&P 500 stocks this year.
