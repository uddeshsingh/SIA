    "maintext": "After a 52% plunge in its stock price so far in 2024, a 6% revenue drop paired with a whopping $16.6 billion loss in the latest quarter, Intel\u2019s board ousted CEO Pat Gelsinger, according to CNBC.\nIt is no accident that Nvidia is having a much better year. The AI chip designer\u2019s stock added 186% this year, its revenue soared 94% and the company\u2019s net margin was a whopping 55% in the third quarter, according to my November Forbes post.\nBut Gelsinger\u2019s resignation will not fix what ails the once great semiconductor giant. The culprit for Intel\u2019s woes comes from a different place \u2014 an organizational structure and compensation system that pits internal fiefdoms against each other, says an industry expert who requested anonymity to maintain his relationship with the company.\nThis expert says Intel cannot even think about how to compete with Nvidia until it replaces the board and general managers with ones who will agree on a radical revamp of that compensation system.\nWhy Was Pat Gelsinger Ousted?\nAfter nearly four years on the job, Gelsinger \u2014 who climbed Intel\u2019s ranks to become chief technology officer during a 30 year career before taking over VMWare and in 2021 rejoining Intel as CEO \u2014 retired December 1 as CEO and left the board, according to the New York Times.\nIntel has suffered a loss of market share and failed to get traction against Nvidia in the AI chip market, as I noted in my book Brain Rush. More recently Intel slashed 15,000 jobs and between 2021 and 2023, the company\u2019s revenue fell more than 30%, the Times reported.\nBut Intel\u2019s problems sprang from too much success. Since the 1980s, Intel was the leading chip company \u2014 selling 80% or more of the CPUs used for PCs \u2014 technology the company later adapted for larger data center computers.\nIntel was too dependent on PCs long after Nvidia had created new growth markets for its GPUs aimed at the gaming, blockchain, and generative AI markets. And Intel lost ground to TSMC in manufacturing, noted the Times.\nWhen he became Intel\u2019s CEO, Gelsinger set out to compete with Samsung and TSMC in chip manufacturing by building chip fabs in Arizona, Ohio and elsewhere while winning government contracts for secure chips and receiving a $7.86 billion grant from the U.S. CHIPS and Science Act. This strategy reduced Intel\u2019s free cash flow and increased the company\u2019s debt, noted CNBC.\nIntel\u2019s board was not happy. \u201cWe have much more work to do at the company and are committed to restoring investor confidence,\u201d the company\u2019s interim executive chair Frank Yeary said in a statement.\nIntel\u2019s board wants Intel to compete more effectively. \u201cWe are working to create a leaner, simpler, more agile Intel,\u201d said Yeary \u2014 who was a key driver in Gelsinger\u2019s ouster according to an anonymous source \u2014 wrote CNBC.\n\u201cIt has been a challenging year for all of us as we have made tough but necessary decisions to position Intel for the current market dynamics,\u201d Gelsinger added in a statement.\nWhat Will Intel\u2019s Board Do Next?\nOn December 2, Intel\u2019s board named Chief Financial Officer David Zinsner and Michelle Johnston Holthaus, general manager of Intel\u2019s client computing group, as interim co-CEOs, reported the Times.\n\u201cWith MJ\u2019s permanent elevation to CEO of Intel Products along with her interim co-CEO role of Intel, we are ensuring the product group will have the resources needed to deliver for our customers,\u201d Yeary said according to a statement.\n\u201cUltimately, returning to process leadership is central to product leadership, and we will remain focused on that mission while driving greater efficiency and improved profitability,\u201d he added.\nI think Intel picked two co-CEOs because the board did not have confidence that Holthaus would be able to handle the financial side. Normally they might have the CFO report to the interim CEO but in this case, they decided they should share the CEO job so the CFO would have equal power.\nSimply put, I think this arrangement is the board's way of saying that Intel's financial position is too delicate not to have a product and financial person share the job. The pair should keep Intel from deteriorating further to help the board\u2019s search committee to find a permanent successor to Gelsinger.\nIntel expressed optimism about the co-CEO arrangement. \u201cWith Dave and MJ\u2019s leadership, we will continue to act with urgency on our priorities: simplifying and strengthening our product portfolio and advancing our manufacturing and foundry capabilities while optimizing our operating expenses and capital,\u201d noted Yeary\u2019s statement.\nCan A New CEO Turnaround Intel?\nIndustry analysts do not see how a new CEO will fix what ails Intel. \u201cThere don\u2019t seem to be any easy answers here, so whoever winds up filling the slot looks in for a tough ride,\u201d Sanford C. Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon wrote in a December 2 note featured by the Times.\nIntel will have trouble recruiting a successor to Gelsinger. \u201cThose in the industry who know Pat will say, \u2018If HE couldn\u2019t fix it, can anyone?\u2019 \u201d a semiconductor industry expert wrote me in a December 2 email.\nGelsinger \u2014 who unlike the co-CEOs knows how semiconductors are made \u2014 was the best choice to turn around Intel. Nobody could fix Intel due to the interdepartmental rivalries that disconnect engineering from marketing and both of them from customers, the expert wrote me.\nTo fix Intel, the expert would replace all the board members and general managers, and redo executive compensation to encourage the departments to work together to develop better products for Intel\u2019s customers, noted the expert.\nOnce Intel\u2019s top team has signed up \u201cto be one company and not ten rival companies, we could work on the roadmap and infrastructure,\u201d the expert wrote.\n\u201cThe question to each group would be: What\u2019s your contribution to plan? In other words (to quote JFK) ask not what Intel can do for you, ask . . .\u201d he added.\nThis outcome seems unlikely and \u2014 absent an acquirer \u2014 so does a recovery in Intel\u2019s stock.",
