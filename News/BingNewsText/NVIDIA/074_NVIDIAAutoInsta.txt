    "maintext": "NVIDIA Auto Installer for Fedora Linux\nA CLI tool which lets you install proprietary NVIDIA drivers and much more easily on Fedora Linux (32 or above and Rawhide)\nActive internet connection\nFedora Linux (32 or above and Rawhide)\nDevice with a discrete NVIDIA GPU\nIf you use Fedora Linux (32 or above and Rawhide) - you can install NVIDIA Auto Installer for Fedora by enabling my COPR repository. Simply execute the following commands in succession to install the tool.\n# dnf install dnf-plugins-core -y # dnf copr enable t0xic0der/nvidia-auto-installer-for-fedora -y # dnf install nvautoinstall -y\nMake sure you have a working internet connection\nInstall the tool from COPR with the above instructions\nExecute nvautoinstall to check installation modes\nRun the installation modes according to your needs\nGive stars to the repository if you found this helpful\nModes of installation\nActive internet connection and superuser privilege is required to execute the following installation modes.\nsudo nvautoinstall rpmadd This mode enables the RPM Fusion NVIDIA drivers repository.\nsudo nvautoinstall driver This mode simply installs the NVIDIA drivers. Enabling the RPM Fusion NVIDIA drivers repository is mandatory before doing this.\nsudo nvautoinstall nvrepo This mode enables the official NVIDIA repository for CUDA software.\nsudo nvautoinstall plcuda This mode installs only the CUDA support softwares. Enabling the RPM Fusion NVIDIA drivers and NVIDIA official repository, and installing the basic drivers are mandatory before doing this.\nsudo nvautoinstall ffmpeg This mode installs only the FFMPEG acceleration. Enabling the RPM Fusion NVIDIA drivers repository and installing the basic drivers are mandatory before doing this.\nsudo nvautoinstall vulkan This mode installs only the Vulkan renderer. Enabling the RPM Fusion NVIDIA drivers repository and installing the basic drivers are mandatory before doing this.\nsudo nvautoinstall vidacc This mode installs only the VDPAU/VAAPI acceleration. Enabling the RPM Fusion NVIDIA drivers repository and installing the basic drivers are mandatory before doing this.\nsudo nvautoinstall getall This mode installs all the above packages. (Not been implemented yet)\nsudo nvautoinstall cheksu This mode allows you to check the current user privilege level. You can use this tool effectively only when you have logged in as a root or sudo user.\nsudo nvautoinstall compat This mode allows you to check your hardware and host compatibility. The tool would check your hardware and host and tell if your device is supported by the tool or not.\nsudo nvautoinstall primec This mode allows you to toggle the PRIME offloading to render all display elements using the discrete card. This has only been tested on Workstation variant of Fedora Linux.\nsudo nvautoinstall --version This mode shows the tool version and exits out.\nsudo nvautoinstall --help This mode shows the help message and exits out.\nActive internet connection is required to download drivers.\nRequires secure boot to be turned off in UEFI systems.\nRequires superuser access for repo addition and driver setup.\nThe drivers are fetched from the RPM Fusion repository.\nUse discretion while using this on other spins.\nOnly tested on 9XX/10XX/20XX/30XX series discrete NVIDIA cards.\nUse discretion while installing with older discrete NVIDIA cards.\nNo additional configuration is required for Optimus setups.\nNative support for PRIME configuration on Optimus.\nComing soon\nCLI \"Launch using Dedicated Graphics Card\" option.\nIntuitive mode switching for hybrid graphics.\nDistinct mode for using integrated or discrete GPU.\nExperimental support for RHEL 8 and CentOS 8.\nSupport for older cards by active querying at NVIDIA.\nThis tool has been tried and tested multiple times and is expected to work flawlessly in Fedora Linux (32 or above, and Rawhide). It has not been tested on any of the spins yet so you are requested to proceed with caution. While the chances of things going wrong is pretty slim, you would still want to make backups, should things do not go as expected. As always, you are choosing to use this tool at your will and you cannot hold me responsible for any mishap that may occur due to the misuse of this tool.\nStarting without any command\n$ nvautoinstall\nUsage: nvautoinstall [OPTIONS] COMMAND [ARGS]... Options: --version Show the version and exit. --help Show this message and exit. Commands: cheksu Check the user privilege level. compat Check your system compatibility. driver Install the NVIDIA driver. ffmpeg Install only the FFMPEG support software. getall Install all the above packages. nvrepo Enable the official NVIDIA repository for CUDA. plcuda Install only the CUDA support software. primec Setup PRIME support. rpmadd Enable the RPM Fusion NVIDIA drivers repository. vidacc Install only the VDPAU/VAAPI acceleration. vulkan Install only the Vulkan support software.\nChecking superuser permissions\n$ sudo nvautoinstall cheksu\n[ # ] NVIDIA AUTOINSTALLER FOR FEDORA LINUX [ \u2605 ] CHECKING SUPERUSER PERMISSIONS...
