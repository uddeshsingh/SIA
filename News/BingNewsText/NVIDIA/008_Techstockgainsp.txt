    "maintext": "Tech stocks pull S&P to another high\nNEW YORK \u2014 Technology stocks pulled Wall Street to another record amid a mixed trading session.\nThe S&P 500 rose 0.2 percent Monday from its all-time high set on Friday to post a record for the 54th time this year. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.3 percent, while the Nasdaq composite gained 1 percent.\nSuper Micro Computer, a stock that's been on an AI-driven roller coaster, soared 28.7 percent to lead the market. Following allegations of misconduct and the resignation of its public auditor, the maker of servers used in artificial-intelligence technology said an investigation found no evidence of misconduct by its management or by the company's board. It also said that it doesn't expect to restate its past financials and that it will strengthen its governance.\nBig Tech stocks also helped prop up the market. Gains of 1.8 percent for Microsoft and 3.2 percent for Meta Platforms were the two strongest forces pushing upward on the S&P 500.\nRetailers were mixed amid what was expected to be the best Cyber Monday on record and coming off Black Friday.\nIntel CEO retires, 2 interims named\nNEW YORK \u2014 Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger has retired, the struggling chipmaker said Dec. 2 in a surprise announcement.\nTwo company executives, David Zinsner and Michelle Johnston Holthaus, will serve as interim co-CEOs while the company searches for a replacement for Gelsinger, who also stepped down from the board.\nThe departure of Gelsinger, whose career spanned more than 40 years, underscores the turmoil at Intel. The company was once a dominant force in the semiconductor industry but has been eclipsed by rival Nvidia, which has cornered the market for chips that run artificial intelligence systems.\nGelsinger started at Intel in 1979 at Intel and was its first chief technology officer. He returned to Intel as chief executive in 2021.\nGelsinger said his exit was \"bittersweet as this company has been my life for the bulk of my working career,\" he said in a statement. \"I can look back with pride at all that we have accomplished together. It has been a challenging year for all of us as we have made tough but necessary decisions to position Intel for the current market dynamics.\"\nGelsinger's departure comes as Intel's financial woes have been piling up. The company posted a $16.6 billion loss in the most recent quarter and the company's shares have fallen by more than half since he took over as CEO. Gelsinger announced plans in August to slash 15 percent of its workforce \u2014 or about 15,000 jobs \u2014 as part of cost-cutting efforts to to save $10 billion in 2025.\nStellantis chief exec is stepping down\nNEW YORK \u2014 Stellantis CEO Carlos Tavares is stepping down after nearly four years in the top spot of the automaker, which owns car brands like Jeep, Citro\u00ebn and Ram, amid an ongoing struggle with slumping sales.\nThe world's fourth-largest carmaker announced that its board accepted his resignation Dec. 1, effective immediately.\nStellantis said the process of finding a new, permanent CEO is \"well under way.\" In the meantime, the company says a new interim executive committee, led by chairman John Elkann, will be established.\nAs head of PSA Peugeot, Tavares took control of the Netherlands-based company in January 2021 \u2014 when it merged with Fiat Chrysler Automobiles, creating an automotive giant that is the parent to several well-known brands today. Beyond Jeep, Citro\u00ebn and Ram, the company portfolio includes Dodge, Chrysler, Fiat, Peugeot, Maserati and Opel.\nStellantis' North American operations had been the company's main source of profits for some time, but struggles piled up this year, with the company citing rising competition and larger market changes. As a result of lofty sticker prices and fewer affordable options, many high-priced vehicles have been left unsold.\nRecord 3.1M travelers screened at US airports\nNEW YORK \u2014 Travelers heading home after the Thanksgiving holiday are setting a record. T\nhe Transportation Security Administration said it screened nearly 3.1 million travelers on Dec. 1, breaking the previous record by about 74,000. That mark was set on July 7, also a Sunday after a holiday, July Fourth.\nHundreds of thousands of travelers were delayed or had their flights canceled. FlightAware says more 6,800 flights were delayed on Sunday, with the highest numbers at Hartsfield\u2013Jackson Atlanta International and Chicago\u2019s O\u2019Hare Airport.\nFed official leans toward a Dec. rate cut\nWASHINGTON \u2014 A top Federal Reserve official said he is leaning toward supporting an interest rate cut but that evidence of persistent inflation before then could cause him to change that view.\nSpeaking at George Washington University, Christopher Waller, a key member of the Fed\u2019s board of governors, said he was confident that inflation is headed lower and that the central bank will likely keep reducing its key rate, which affects many consumer and business loans.\nBut he noted that there\u2019s a risk that inflation \u201cmay be getting stuck above\u201d the 2 percent target, which would support an argument for keeping the rate unchanged when the Fed meets later this month.\nUS commits to $7.5B for battery plants\nDETROIT \u2014 A Stellantis joint venture with Samsung SDI has won a commitment from the U.S. Energy Department for up to a $7.54 billion loan to help build two electric vehicle battery plants in Kokomo, Ind.\nThe project being built by StarPlus Energy LLC is expected to create at least 2,800 jobs at the plants and hundreds more at parts suppliers. StarPlus has to meet technical, legal, environmental and financial conditions.\nIt\u2019s unclear whether the loan will be funded before President-elect Donald Trump takes office on Jan. 20. Trump has pledged to end funding for EV projects, which he called the \u201cgreen new scam.\u201d\nFeds open up a Microsoft antitrust probe\nWASHINGTON \u2014 Antitrust enforcers with the Federal Trade Commission have opened a wide-ranging investigation into Microsoft\u2019s business practices, starting off a big legal project that an incoming Trump administration must take up or abandon.\nThe FTC is investigating Microsoft\u2019s cloud computing business and related product lines such as artificial intelligence and cybersecurity, according to a person who was not authorized to publicly discuss details of the investigation and spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity.\nIt\u2019s the latest action of more than three years of aggressive antitrust enforcement shepherded by FTC Chair Lina Chan, who was elevated to lead the agency by President Joe Biden after he came into office pledging tougher scrutiny of monopolistic behavior by Big Tech companies.\nVV workers hold 2-hour rolling strikes\nFRANKFURT, Germany \u2014 Volkswagen workers launched rolling two-hour strikes Monday at nine plants across Germany to underscore their resistance to 10 percent pay cuts and factory closures the company says are necessary to cope with a slack European auto market.\nThe work stoppages included the VWompany's base plant at Wolfsburg, where workers rallied against a cost-cutting drive by the automaker's management in which they face the threat of the company's first plant closures in its home country.\nVW has said it must lower costs in Germany to levels achieved by competitors and by its plants in eastern Europe and South America.\nChief employee representative Daniela Cavallo has said employees should not shoulder the burden of management failures to develop attractive products and come up with a cheaper, entry-level electric vehicle.\nThe so-called warning strikes, a common tactic in German wage negotiations, are taking place as part of talks for a new labor agreement after a mandatory peace period that bars strikes expired on Sunday. The IG Metall industrial union said any job actions beyond those occurring on Monday would be announced later.\n.",
