Hallam Bullock here, once again writing to you from London. Black Friday is upon us and Business Insider's Reviews team has rounded up the best deals on the products and brands they swear by.\nIn today's newsletter, we're looking at how Nvidia expanded nearly 20-fold in just over 20 years.\nIf this was forwarded to you, sign up here.\nThe big story\nNvidia's meteoric rise\nA few years ago, Nvidia was largely unknown. It's difficult to believe, considering the company can now boast about back-to-back earnings beats, a market capitalization of more than $3 trillion, and a stock price that has climbed nearly 200% over the past 12 months \u2014 Citi analysts also recently eyed a catalyst that could push the stock a further 27% by January.\nAdvertisement\nSo, how can a company grow so much, so quickly? The data behind the evolution of Nvidia's workforce tells the story, BI's Emma Cosgrove writes.\nNvidia's workforce has grown nearly 20-fold since 2003. Beyond its historic rise in market value, this growth has been aided by a slew of employee incentives, including a futuristic headquarters that reflects the company's \"no barriers and no boundaries\" philosophy (it's easy to see why they named the building \"Voyager\").\nThis workforce growth continued through 2024, a particularly brutal year for the Tech industry, during which time Meta and Google made significant cuts.\nAdvertisement\nIt's one of the best-paying firms in Silicon Valley. In 2019, Microsoft's median employee salary was nearly $20,000 higher than a Nvidia worker. As of January 2024, Nvidia's median salary (excluding the CEO) had surpassed Microsoft and reached more than $220,000. As the above chart illustrates, it's also left other tech giants in the dust.\nNvidia's revenue per employee has recovered after years of investment. The company's revenue-to-headcount ratio showed a downward trend from 2003 until 2014, and then steady upward progress until the AI boom in 2023. During that year, this ratio doubled. This is in part due to early investment in building a programming software layer called CUDA \u2014 the main element that keeps AI builders from easily switching to competing hardware.\nHowever, the company isn't as far ahead in other areas. Gender representation in the company's workforce and the semiconductor industry as a whole has remained relatively unchanged in the last decade, Emma writes.\nNews brief\nTop headlines\nChina reacts to Donald Trump's tariff announcement, calling the move ineffective and unjustified.\nCanada is Google's latest antitrust legal challenger, and it wants the tech giant to sell two of its adtech products.\nThe five biggest swings Netflix took this year, from a massive push into live sports to overhauling its film strategy.\nBaby boomer homeowners got rich from skyrocketing house prices.
