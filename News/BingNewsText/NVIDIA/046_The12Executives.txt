    "maintext": "Above a table in a San Jose, Calif., Denny\u2019s hangs a plaque that reads: \u201cThe booth that launched a $1 trillion company.\u201d The breakfast spot is where, in 1993, engineers Jensen Huang, Chris Malachowsky and Curtis Priem founded the technology company Nvidia (NVDA). As evidenced by the chain\u2019s celebratory plaque, Nvidia surpassed the $1 trillion mark last year. Today, the company\u2019s dominance in the A.I. revolution has boosted its market cap to nearly $3.6 trillion, making it the world\u2019s most valuable publicly traded company.\nSign Up For Our Daily Newsletter\nThank you for signing up!\nBy clicking submit, you agree to our terms of service and acknowledge we may use your information to send you emails, product samples, and promotions on this website and other properties.

While the company started off with a vision to reimagine realistic 3D graphics with chips known as graphics processing units (GPUs), it faced several pitfalls along the way\u2014including a graphics format issue in 1996 that forced Huang, the company\u2019s CEO, to lay off more than half of its employees\nThree years later, Nvidia launched the industry\u2019s first GPU, the GeForce 256, and became a major player in computer graphics and gaming. Despite its success in that industry, Huang decided to pivot toward A.I. more than a decade ago in the hopes that the nascent technology would take off. His bet has paid off handsomely, with Big Tech players like Microsoft (MSFT), Meta (META), Google (GOOGL) and Amazon (AMZN) now spending billions of dollars on the Nvidia chips used to power their generative A.I. models.\nBesides a penchant for leather jackets, Huang is known for his unique leadership style\u2014his executive team contains more than 60 people, all of whom report directly to the CEO. \u201cIt\u2019s not conventional, but I\u2019m certain that it\u2019s the best practice,\u201d Huang told Patrick Collison, CEO of Stripe, of the structure earlier this year. In addition to Nvidia\u2019s innovation in A.I., data centers and gaming, the company is also a powerhouse in visualization and automotive technologies.\nHere\u2019s a look at some of the top leaders helping Nvidia ride the A.I. wave to unprecedented heights:\nJensen Huang, CEO\nHuang has served as the CEO and president of Nvidia since its establishment. He owns around 3 percent of the company and has seen his personal net worth swell to an estimated $128 billion over the years, placing Huang among the ten wealthiest people in the world.\nHuang, who earned a Bachelor of Science from Oregon State University and a master\u2019s in electrical engineering from Stanford, previously worked at companies like LSI Logic and Advanced Micro Devices. But his first-ever job was as a dishwasher at Denny\u2019s\u2014the very same restaurant that would later serve as the location for Nvidia\u2019s inception. \u201cI used to clean bathrooms, and now I\u2019m CEO of a company\u2026 There are a lot of things in life I believe you can learn,\u201d Huang told Collison when asked why he rarely fires employees. \u201cPeople know that I\u2019d rather torture them into greatness. \u201d\nChris Malachowsky, Nvidia fellow\nHuang\u2019s fellow co-founder Malachowsky has held several different positions at Nvidia, where he\u2019s overseen areas like IT, operations and product engineering. The executive, who previously held engineering and technical leadership roles at HP and Sun Microsystems, currently focuses on growing the company\u2019s core technologies as an \u201cNvidia fellow\u201d and its senior technology executive.\nMalachowsky is also an expert on integrated circuit design and holds some 35 patents. In addition to his work at Silicon Valley-based Nvidia, he serves as an advisor to the Wertheim College of Engineering at the University of Florida.\nColette Kress, chief financial officer\nKress, another member of Nvidia\u2019s executive staff, was recruited by Huang in 2013. Her tenure at the company has included Nvidia\u2019s entry into the $1 trillion club, and then the $3 trillion club, with Kress helping guide Nvidia\u2019s soaring growth across its data center business.\nHer leadership \u201chas been instrumental in Nvidia\u2019s success with Wall Street and is key to Jensen\u2019s vision,\u201d Dan Ives, a Wedbush Securities analyst, told Fortune in June. Before joining Nvidia, Kress was chief financial officer for Cisco\u2019s business technology and operations finance division and spent more than a dozen years at Microsoft, where her roles included chief financial officer of its server and tools sector.\nJay Puri, executive vice president of worldwide field operations\nAs head of worldwide field operations, Puri oversees all things related to Nvidia\u2019s global business. The executive\u2019s responsibilities include areas like sales, partnerships, program management and organizing support services.\nBefore joining Nvidia in 2005, Puri spent more than two decades in sales, marketing and management at Sun Microsystems, where his positions included a stint as senior vice president of its Asia-Pacific Group. Before that, Puri worked in roles at Hewlett-Packard, Booz Allen and Texas Instruments.\nDebora Shoquist, executive vice president of operations\nAfter more than 20 years spent managing operations at companies like Quantum and Coherent, Shoquist joined Nvidia in 2007. As head of operations, she oversees Nvidia\u2019s supply chain functions, logistics and quality management system.\nShoquist\u2019s role involves working closely with the company\u2019s global suppliers, which notably includes the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC). In what constitutes one of the most lucrative partnerships in A.I., Nvidia counts on TSCMC to manufacture chips such as those belonging to its next-generation Blackwell platform.\nDwight Diercks, senior vice president of software engineering\nAs one of Nvidia\u2019s longest-serving employees, Diercks has been with the technology company since he became its 22nd employee in 1994. Initially joining as a senior software engineer, he has acted as senior vice president of software engineering since 2008 and leads a team that builds the software underpinning its A.I. accelerators, autonomous vehicle technology and gaming products.\nDiercks, who previously worked as a software engineer at Pellucid, Inc. and Compaq Computer Group, has also demonstrated an interest in A.I. applications outside of work. Earlier this year, he donated $20 million to fund programs at the Mayo Clinic that will use the new technology for early detection and cancer treatment.\nJeff Fisher, senior vice president of GeForce\nLike Diercks, Fisher joined Nvidia three decades ago. During the company\u2019s early days, its initial office was so small that Nvidia employees shared an office bathroom with another company and ate their meals around a ping pong table, he recalled in 2017.\nStarting as the company\u2019s first salesman, Fisher worked his way up to become the head of its GeForce business unit, which produces the company\u2019s line of GPUs for gaming and 3D rendering. Before joining Nvidia, he previously worked in sales at Adaptec and the Weitek Corporation.\nJonah Alben, senior vice president of GPU engineering\nAlben, since 2008, has headed GPU engineering at Nvidia, where his team focuses on enhancing the capabilities of next-gen chips. Before joining the company in 1997, he briefly worked at Silicon Graphics.\n\u201cWe had a vision that when we put GPUs out in the world\u2026 that somewhere somebody out there in the world would find these GPUs and would use them for some new problem that we didn\u2019t even know about,\u201d said Alben during a 2020 podcast interview.\nIan Buck, vice president and general manager of accelerated computing\nIan Buck oversees Nvidia\u2019s vast data center business. Buck has been with Huang\u2019s company for 20 years and started as a systems engineer and director. In charge of hardware and software for data centers and A.I. applications, Buck has testified on A.I. before the U.S. Congress and urged federal agencies to invest in and adopt the new technology to bolster the economy.\nWhile completing a Ph.D. at Stanford in the early 2000s, Buck helped develop the programming language Brook. At Nvidia, his team helped build CUDA, a parallel computing platform and programming model introduced in 2006 that built off Buck\u2019s Stanford research and helps developers speed up applications through GPUs.\nRev Lebaredian, vice president of Omniverse and simulation technology\nBefore embarking on a 22-year career at Nvidia, Lebaredian specialized in visual effects rendering at Warner Brothers Digital and Disney Dream Quest Images and even launched his own company, Steamboat Software, in 1999. Lebaredian joined Nvidia in 2002, where he now heads the company\u2019s Omniverse system and simulation technology.\nBringing together generative A.I. with renderings and physics simulations, Nvidia\u2019s Omniverse allows for the creation of so-called \u201cdigital twins,\u201d which virtually replicate environments and processes to help companies solve issues across areas like factory scale, robotics development or even climate research.\nDanny Shapiro, vice president of automotive\nShapiro has been with Nvidia since 2009 and currently heads its automotive division. In addition to working on in-vehicle improvements and automobile design, Shapiro\u2019s team is focused on enabling A.I. self-driving through the company\u2019s Nvidia Drive platforms.\nIt shouldn\u2019t come as a surprise that Shapiro drives an electric vehicle powered by his California home\u2019s solar system. Before joining Nvidia, the executive held marketing, engineering and business development positions at Advanced Micro Devices, Silicon Graphics and Digital Equipment.\nMohammed Siddeek, corporate vice president and head of NVentures\nSiddeek and Nvidia go way back. In the 1990s, he helped the company go public while working at Morgan Stanley (MS) and subsequently joined Nvidia as an investor relations manager in the 2000s before breaking away to work at SoftBank (SFTBF)\u2019s Vision Fund.",
