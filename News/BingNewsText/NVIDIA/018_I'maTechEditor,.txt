This digital edition of Sony's PlayStation 5 console has a slimmer build than launch models and eschews a disc drive, but comes with a DualSense controller, 1,000 V-Bucks, and a few Fortnite cosmetics.\nPS5 Slim Disc Edition Fortnite Bundle: $425 at Amazon (was $500). This slim version of Sony's PlayStation 5 console has a disc drive for playing physical games and comes with a DualSense controller, 1,000 V-Bucks, and a handful of Fortnite cosmetics.\nMicrosoft Xbox Series S 512GB: $250 at Target (was $300). This entry-level Xbox allows players access to the Xbox library and ecosystem, albeit with a few performance compromises. Comes with an Xbox Core Wireless Gaming Controller.\nMicrosoft Xbox Series X 1TB: $400 at Best Buy (was $450). Microsoft's top-of-the-line Xbox, the Xbox Series X can play the console's entire library at maximum fidelity. Comes with an Xbox Core Wireless Gaming Controller.\nMeta Quest 3S (256GB): $399 at Amazon with free $30 digital credit. While Meta's freshly released budget revamp of the Meta Quest 3 isn't exactly on sale at the moment, you can snag its higher capacity model in a bundle with Batman: Arkham Shadow and a $30 Amazon gift card (with code QUEST30 at checkout) if you act fast.\nPlayStation VR2: $349 at Amazon (was $550). This massive deal is so large that Amazon's website can't actually display it properly. Right now, you can get Sony's second VR headset for $250 off its launch price, which will grant PS5 owners access to Sony's PSVR 2 library (though oddly enough, not PSVR 1 titles) and PC owners a new way to play their SteamVR games. This isn't exactly a console in the traditional sense, as it's not standalone\u2014 you'll need either a PS5 or a PC to use it.\nAmazon Fire TV 4K Max with Xbox Core Wireless Controller and 1 Month Xbox Game Pass Ultimate: $80 at Amazon (was $142). This bundle will snag you Amazon's best streaming stick plus an Xbox controller and 1 month of Xbox Game Pass Ultimate, turning it into a full-on cloud gaming device. It's not exactly a console in the traditional sense, but it'll get the job done, and is much more affordable (at least until the subscription fees start adding up)\nThe best Cyber Monday game controller sales\nEven if you've already got a console, you always need more controllers:\nPlayStation DualSense Wireless Controller: $54 at Amazon (was $75). PS5 controllers can be a bit more finicky to connect to other devices than Xbox controllers, but have improved greatly in this regard over the years, and come with plenty of extra haptics that might justify their higher price tag to some gamers.\nHori Split Pad Pro for Nintendo Switch: $42.49 at Best Buy (was $50). The Hori Split Pad Pro sometimes feels like a downright necessary upgrade for playing the Switch in portable mode, making it far more comfortable to hold over extended periods.\nCRKD Nitro Deck+ for Nintendo Switch: $50 at Amazon (was $70). This alternate Joy-Con replacement acts as a full external shell for the Nintendo Switch, essentially giving it a much more Steam Deck style look and feel.\n8BitDo Ultimate Bluetooth Controller: $48 at Amazon (was $70). This is a reliable third-party alternative to the official Nintendo Switch Pro Controller, with both Bluetooth and 2.4 GHz connectivity, plus motion controls, back paddles, macro compatibility, and durable Hall Effect sticks.\nXbox Core Wireless Gaming Controller: $40 at Amazon (was $60). Almost no video game accessory is as versatile as the basic Xbox controller, which can work across a slew of devices and has a standard layout that most games recognize immediately.\nBackbone One Mobile Gaming Controller: $70 at Amazon (was $100). These days, mobiles phones are practically gaming consoles in their own right, but controlling one with a touchscreen can be a pain. The Backbone One is a longstanding favorite phone controller among mobile gaming enthusiasts.\nThe best Cyber Monday gaming laptop sales\nConsoles aren't the only way to game, and this Cyber Monday has a lot of great deals on gaming laptops for those would would rather play on PC.\nDell Alienware m16 R2 Gaming Laptop with Intel Core Ultra 9 chip: $1,300 at Dell (was $1,700).

While Valve's handheld rarely goes on sale, alternatives from the likes of Asus, Lenovo, and MSI are getting hefty cuts this Cyber Monday.\nAsus ROG Ally: $500 at Best Buy (was $650).
