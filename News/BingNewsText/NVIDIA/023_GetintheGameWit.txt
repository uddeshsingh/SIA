If you buy through affiliate links, we may earn commissions, which help support our testing.\nI'm Matthew Buzzi, PCMag's lead reviewer for gaming PCs. I've been at PCMag since 2015, so that means I\u2019ve reviewed hundreds of gaming PCs here over the years. I take satisfaction in identifying the best-value combinations of processors (CPUs), graphics processors (GPUs), and feature sets across gaming laptops and gaming desktops.\nAfter poring through scores of Cyber Monday deals, I\u2019ve selected four top gaming PC deals below, including three laptops and one desktop from Acer, Asus, Lenovo, and MSI. A potent graphics chip is vital for a gaming system, and even though each of these picks occupies different pricing positions in their categories, all three have capable GPUs and fast processors that will satisfy the most discerning gamers.\nThe MSI Katana A15 AI is already a serious value made even better with this Cyber Monday deal. This gaming laptop's specs are closer to the midrange than the budget category, with a snappy AMD Ryzen 7 8845HS CPU, 32GB of memory, and a 1TB solid-state drive. That's a tremendous foundation for the cost, though its 144Hz 1080p screen is the baseline. The Nvidia GeForce RTX 4060 GPU is a steady and competent mainstream gaming GPU not often seen at this price. The RTX 4050 (or lower) is more common at this price. Particularly at 1080p resolution, the RTX 4060 can shine with smooth frame rates at high settings\u2014just not maxed out. For everything else, the CPU and RAM will ensure a speedy experience. Gaming hardware can be expensive, and we stand by this package at its normal price, so nearly $300 off is a sweet deal. While we didn't review this specific model, a previous MSI Katana 15 model sat atop our list of the best cheap gaming laptops for several months.\nFor gamers seeking more than entry-level power, the Asus TUF Gaming A16 is a high-end laptop discounted to a midrange price for Cyber Monday. Available for $500 off, this laptop's RTX 4070 GPU should catch any gamer's eye, capable of high-resolution and high-refresh play in all modern games. Even better, its AMD Ryzen 9 7940HX CPU should deliver blazing-fast performance in all areas, and its 1TB SSD leaves plenty of room for games. Its 16:10 display features a sharp QHD+ resolution and a 165Hz refresh rate, enabling clear and fast gaming, and Wi-Fi 6 should keep downloads and online gaming sessions smooth. (Though its Ethernet port all but guarantees that.) We didn't review this exact model, but as we found with the smaller Asus TUF Gaming A14, this line is generally well-built.\nThis Lenovo LOQ's normal $999 price is a decent deal, but not one that would turn heads for the specs. However, with more than $200 off for Cyber Monday, it becomes a genuine bargain. It's difficult to get a gaming laptop for this price, and while these components won't set the world on fire, they get you in the door to mainstream gaming. An RTX 4050 GPU and an AMD Ryzen 7 8845HS processor are capable enough for 1080p play as long as you expect to lower some details. (We recently reviewed an Intel GPU version of the Lenovo LOQ 15, and it's safe to bet the Nvidia model will perform better.) All but hard-core players will be pleased will be very happy with this system.\nIf you don't need to take your games on the go, I found a steal on this iBuyPower desktop. It's more for hard-core players than casuals, but this Cyber Monday discount helps broaden its appeal. (We also reviewed a previous version of the iBuyPower Y40, giving it our Editors' Choice award.) The Y40 has a clean-looking case, but it's got a nice big window for looking in at your prized parts. It packs an AMD Ryzen 7 7700 CPU, an Nvidia GeForce RTX 4070 GPU, 16GB of memory, and a 1TB SSD. That's a decent value for a $1,600 PC with this GPU, but taking $400 off makes it a doorbuster-level deal.\nFor more bargains, visit our Cyber Monday deals page, which includes the entire field of offers and more specific category-based picks.\nMore Cyber Monday Deals\nApple AirPods Pro 2 ANC Earbuds With USB-C Charging Case for $154.00 (List Price $249.00)\nMeta Quest 3S 256GB VR Headset + $30 Digital Credit for $399 With Code \"QUEST30\"\nApple iPad 10.9\" 64GB Wi-Fi Retina Tablet (2022 Release) for $279.00 (List Price $349.00)\nSamsung Galaxy Tab A9+ 64GB Wi-Fi 11\" Tablet for $149.00 (List Price $219.99)\nBlink Outdoor 4 1080p Security Camera (3-Pack) for $99.99 (List Price $259.99)\nBose QuietComfort Wireless Noise Cancelling Headphones for $199.00 (List Price $349.00)\nApple Watch Series 10 (GPS, 42mm, Black, S/M, Sports Band) for $329.00 (List Price $399.00)\niRobot Roomba Vac Essential Q0120 Robot Vacuum Cleaner for $149.00 (List Price $249.99)\nSteelSeries Arctis Nova Pro Wireless Gaming Headset (Black) for $269.99 (List Price $349.99)\nSamsung Odyssey G93SC 49\" Dual QHD OLED Curved Monitor for $949.99 (List Price $1,599.99)\n*Deals are selected by our commerce team",
