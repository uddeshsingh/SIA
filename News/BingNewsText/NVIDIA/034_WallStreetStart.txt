    "maintext": "Wall Street opened December with a mixed performance, highlighted by record-breaking highs and sector-driven fluctuations.\nThe S&P 500 edged up 0.2 percent by midday, building on its best month of the year.\nIn contrast, the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 0.2 percent, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq composite rose 0.8 percent, buoyed by gains in artificial intelligence-related stocks and optimism in retail.\nSuper Micro Computer led the market's upward momentum, with its stock soaring 24.2 percent after an internal investigation cleared the company of fraud allegations.\nThe maker of servers used in AI technology also announced plans to bolster governance by appointing a new chief financial officer and general counsel.\nIntel CEO Pat Gelsinger Retires\nChipmaker Intel also made significant gains, with its shares climbing 5.2 percent after CEO Pat Gelsinger's retirement was announced.\nThe company's board expressed its commitment to restoring investor confidence as it searches for Gelsinger's successor. Intel has faced pressure to regain its footing after losing its spot in the Dow Jones Industrial Average to Nvidia, a beneficiary of Wall Street's future-driven rally.\nOn the flip side, automaker Stellantis faced sharp losses, with its stock tumbling 6.3 percent after CEO Carlos Tavares announced his departure. The company, which owns brands such as Jeep and Citro\u00ebn, continues to struggle with declining sales and inventory issues.\nAnalysts view Tavares' exit as a pivotal moment for the world's fourth-largest automaker as it seeks to regain stability in a competitive market.\nAmazon Stock Rises on Cyber Monday\nMonday's figures suggest the utility sector saw significant movement as well.\nPG&E experienced the steepest drop in the S&P 500, falling 7 percent following its decision to raise $2.4 billion by selling stock and preferred shares.\nThis move aims to provide the company with much-needed liquidity.\nRetail stocks presented a mixed picture amid expectations of record-setting Cyber Monday sales. Amazon climbed 1.7 percent, reflecting optimism for online retail, while Target fell 2.2 percent after issuing a lackluster holiday sales forecast.\nWalmart's shares remained largely unchanged, maintaining investor confidence after its more favorable outlook.\nU.S. Dollar Strengthens Against Euro\nCurrency markets reacted to the prior week's political and economic developments.\nU.S. President-elect Donald Trump's threat of 100 percent tariffs on developing economies, including Brazil, Russia, India and China, made little immediate impact. However, the U.S. dollar gained against several currencies, notably the euro, which dropped 0.7 percent amid France's contentious budget negotiations.\nTreasury yields were steady, with the 10-year yield at 4.18 percent after early gains. A report on U.S. manufacturing showed contraction for the month, albeit less severe than expected.\nKey labor market reports are set to shape the Federal Reserve's monetary policy as economists anticipate an uptick in November hiring after October's slow growth due to hurricanes and strikes.\n\"We now find ourselves in the middle of this Goldilocks zone, where economic health supports earnings growth while remaining weak enough to justify potential Fed rate cuts,\" said Mark Hackett, chief of investment research at Nationwide.\nGlobally, Chinese manufacturing strength lifted Asian markets, with Shanghai and Hong Kong indexes rising 1.1 percent and 0.7 percent, respectively. In Europe, Germany's DAX rose 1.4 percent, while France's CAC 40 fell 0.2 percent, reflecting divergent economic conditions.\nThis article includes reporting from The Associated Press.",
