    "maintext": "Stock Analyst Note\nTesla: Shares Rally on Trump Plans for Autonomous Vehicle Framework\nTesla shares rallied and were up 7% at the time of writing on Nov. 18 on a Bloomberg report that President-elect Donald Trump plans to create a federal framework for self-driving vehicles in the US Department of Transportation. Given that Tesla CEO Elon Musk is also an advisor to Trump, we think any framework created would be favorable for Tesla\u2019s self-driving technology. This would remove some regulatory hurdles for the rollout of Tesla\u2019s planned Robotaxi service, including the Cybercab that would be a fully autonomous vehicle.\nSeth Goldstein\nStock Analyst Note\nTesla: Trump Election May Solidify Near-Term Tesla US EV Leadership\nTesla shares were up 12% at the time of writing on the news that Donald Trump was elected to become the next US president. The largest implication we see for EVs and lithium demand is a potential change to the EV subsidies that were created in the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022. Should this occur, we would expect to see lower near-term US EV sales, slightly weighing on lithium demand.\nSeth Goldstein\nStock Analyst Note\nTesla Earnings: Margin Recovery Underway as Long-Term Objectives Intact\nTesla delivered third-quarter earnings above consensus estimates. During the first half of the year, Tesla's profit margins fell to multiyear low levels, largely due to a decline in the automotive segment. In the third quarter, Tesla's automotive business generated 160 basis points of gross profit margin expansion to 20.1% driven by deliveries growth; lower cost per vehicle\u2014including lower raw materials costs; and higher autonomous driving software revenue. In our view, the results signal that the first half of 2024 was likely the bottom for Tesla's automotive gross profits, as we expect fourth-quarter results will also exceed 20%.\nSeth Goldstein\nCompany Report\nTesla's Strategic Focus Shifts to Development of Affordable Vehicles, Cost Reductions, and AI\nTesla is one of the largest battery electric vehicle automakers in the world. In less than a decade, the company went from a startup to a globally recognized luxury automaker with its Model S and Model X vehicles. Tesla competes in the entry-level luxury car and midsize crossover sport utility vehicle markets with its Model 3 and Model Y vehicles. It also sells a light truck\u2014the Cybertruck\u2014and a semi truck. The company plans to launch an affordable SUV, luxury sports car, and robotaxi in the future.\nSeth Goldstein\nStock Analyst Note\nTesla: Robotaxi Event Features Two Vehicle Prototypes\nWe're maintaining our $200 fair value estimate and narrow moat rating for Tesla following the company's robotaxi event. We view the shares as slightly overvalued, trading a little less than 20% above our fair value estimate but in 3-star territory.\nSeth Goldstein\nCompany Report\nTesla's Strategic Focus Shifts to Development of Affordable Vehicles, Cost Reductions, and AI\nTesla is one of the largest battery electric vehicle automakers in the world.

The deliveries number was in line with our outlook for the cadence of the year and sets up Tesla to hit our full-year deliveries forecast of just below 1.8 million vehicles, roughly flat with the 1.81 million deliveries number for 2023. Tesla also announced energy storage deployments of 6.4 gigawatt hours. This puts the company on track for our forecast of 26.5 GWh of energy deployments for the year. With our outlook largely intact, we're maintaining our Tesla fair value estimate of $200 following the third-quarter deliveries and grid storage deployments results. Our narrow moat rating is also unchanged.\nSeth Goldstein\nCompany Report\nTesla\u2019s Strategic Focus Shifts to Development of Affordable Vehicle, Cost Reductions, and AI\nTesla is one of the largest battery electric vehicle automakers in the world.

The company plans to launch an affordable SUV and luxury sports car in the future.\nSeth Goldstein\nStock Analyst Note\nTesla: Management Aims to Roll Out FSD to China and Europe in First Quarter of 2025\nTesla's artificial intelligence team announced its product release roadmap, which includes plans to launch its full self-driving software in Europe and China in the first quarter of 2025, pending regulatory approval. Our forecast already assumes 50% adoption rate growth in FSD in 2025 versus 2024. Accordingly, we see no reason to change our outlook based on this announcement. We're maintaining our $200 fair value estimate and narrow moat rating for Tesla.\nSeth Goldstein\nStock Analyst Note\nTesla Earnings: Affordable Vehicle Still on Track for 2025 Launch and 2026 Ramp\nTesla's second-quarter results were largely in line with our view for the cadence of the year. Operating profits were down roughly 33% year over year due largely to lower average automotive selling prices, but up 37% sequentially versus the first quarter, driven by strong energy generation and storage profits and lower corporate expenses. With our outlook largely unchanged, we maintain our $200 per share fair value estimate. Our narrow moat rating also remains unchanged.\nSeth Goldstein\nCompany Report\nTesla\u2019s Strategic Focus Shifts to Development of Affordable Vehicle, Cost Reductions, and AI\nTesla is one of the largest battery electric vehicle automakers in the world.

The report cites Tesla's desire to build additional prototypes as the reason for the delay. We see no reason to change our outlook based on the delayed investor event. Accordingly, we maintain our $200 fair value estimate for Tesla. Our narrow moat rating is also unchanged.\nSeth Goldstein\nStock Analyst Note\nTesla: Deliveries Fall 5% Year on Year During Second Quarter\nTesla reported 443,956 vehicles delivered during the second quarter, which is a 5% decline year over year versus the prior-year quarter. We've updated our model to assume lower 2024 deliveries. We now expect a slight decline versus our prior forecast for deliveries to be slightly up on the year. Separately, we've updated our model to assume higher energy storage deployments, as we expect higher growth in this business following Tesla's record 9.4 GWh deployments during the second quarter. Having updated our model to reflect these changes, we maintain our $200 fair value estimate for Tesla. Our narrow moat rating is also unchanged.\nSeth Goldstein\nCompany Report\nTesla\u2019s Strategic Focus Shifts From Growth to Development of Affordable Vehicle and Cost Reductions\nTesla is one of the largest battery electric vehicle automakers in the world.

Shareholders voted with the board recommendations on nearly every proposal, including approving CEO Elon Musk's 2018 compensation package as well as reincorporating in the US state of Texas from Delaware. We see no reason to change our outlook for Tesla as a result of the vote. Accordingly, we maintain our $200 fair value estimate. Our narrow moat rating is also unchanged.\nSeth Goldstein\nStock Analyst Note\nUS Tariffs on Chinese EVs Do Not Change Our View of US EV Adoption\nThe US on May 13, 2024, announced a series of new tariffs on Chinese imports. These include a 100% tariff on electric vehicles and a 25% tariff on lithium-ion batteries and battery parts. There was also a 25% tariff on critical minerals, which include graphite, permanent magnets, and cobalt.\nSeth Goldstein\nCompany Report\nTesla\u2019s Strategic Focus Shifts From Growth to Development of Affordable Vehicle and Cost Reductions\nTesla is one of the largest battery electric vehicle automakers in the world.

This round includes Tesla letting go of nearly all of the supercharging team.\nSeth Goldstein\nStock Analyst Note\nTesla: Full Self-Driving Approval in China Supports Our View for Deliveries Growth in 2024\nOn April 29, Tesla shares rose over 10% at the time of writing. The rally was due to multiple media outlets reporting that Tesla cleared regulatory hurdles in China and was given tentative approval by the Chinese government to begin selling its full self-driving driver-assistance software (FSD). The move should drive Tesla sales higher in China, where the automaker is facing increasing competition with many electric vehicle manufacturers competing on lower prices. Additionally, the ability to sell FSD software in a new market should drive higher adoption rates. In our view, Tesla's FSD is currently a differentiator as we view Tesla as a leader in driver-assistance software. For FSD in China, Tesla will partner with Baidu to use Baidu's mapping and navigation services, which should help accelerate FSD in China.\nSeth Goldstein",
