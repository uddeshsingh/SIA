    "maintext": "Tesla (TSLA) shares rose Monday as two analysts offered optimistic outlooks for the electric vehicle maker.\nRoth Capital Partners upgraded the stock to \u201cbuy\u201d from \u201cneutral,\u201d setting a price target of $380\u2014,nearly $300 more than its previous position. In a note to clients, Roth said CEO Elon Musk\u2019s close relationship with President-elect Donald Trump will likely increase demand for Tesla vehicles.\nStifel also significantly lifted its price target, raising it $124 to $411 while maintaining a \"buy\" rating on the stock. The analysts, led by Stephen Gengaro, also pointed to Tesla\u2019s self-driving technology, as well as its CyberCab robotaxi, according to reports.\nShares of Tesla, recently up more than 3%, recently traded at their highest level in two-and-a-half years, changing hands a bit below $360. Wall Street's average price target is below current levels at near $280, according to Visible Alpha data.\nRoth's report noted that it's anticipated Trump will end the $7,500 federal tax credit for EV buyers, which \u201cshould indirectly benefit Tesla, as we expect mainline OEM competitors to continue their retreat from the EV market.\u201d",
