    "maintext": "Odds are, Ford CEO Jim Farley and General Motors CEO Mary Barra have either already voted in the election or will on Tuesday. Thankfully, though, we have absolutely no idea who which candidate they actually support. Your guess is about as good as mine. Tesla CEO Elon Musk, on the other hand, has made it abundantly clear that he\u2019s all-in for Trump. And he doesn\u2019t just want Trump to win \u2014 he\u2019s spending millions and actively campaigning on his behalf. If Trump wins, Musk and his companies will absolutely benefit, but what happens if the convicted felon loses?\nIt certainly isn\u2019t illegal or unprecedented for a billionaire CEO to use their money and influence in an attempt to sway the election in favor of their preferred candidate, and yet, Musk may still find himself in legal trouble over his political action committee\u2019s possible violation of human trafficking laws, the possible lying on his immigration paperwork and his buddy-buddy relationship with enemy dictator Vladimir Putin. That\u2019s not even the complete list, just a handful of the most immediate issues that deserve investigating.\nStill, we don\u2019t know how aggressively the Harris administration would go after Musk, especially in the months immediately following her inauguration. After all, there\u2019s a chance that post-election and post-inauguration right-wing violence will cause more than its fair share of distractions. They\u2019re already burning ballot boxes, so there\u2019s no reason to believe they\u2019ll take a Trump loss peacefully. Regardless of what any investigation concludes, though, the wheels of justice turn slowly, and he probably won\u2019t face any actual consequences for a while, if he ever does.\nYou also can\u2019t forget about that whole two-tiered justice system we have that seems specifically geared toward keeping the rich out of prison. If his cozy little nighttime chats with Putin weren\u2019t enough to prevent the Pentagon from using SpaceX to launch a network of spy satellites, it\u2019s hard to have much faith that the Harris administration won\u2019t continue her predecessor\u2019s policy of simply letting him get away with everything.\nWhether it\u2019s for show or something he actually believes, Musk\u2019s behavior on Twitter lately certainly suggests he isn\u2019t confident his status as the richest person in the world will keep him safe. In addition to all his other garbage tweets, Musk is also spreading the idea that Democrats plan to destroy him, and in his interview with TV dinner trust fund baby Tucker Carlson, said he\u2019s fucked if Trump loses. Why he\u2019s threatening me with a good time, I don\u2019t know, but it probably has something to do with all the ketamine.\nIf Musk does go down, though, that would likely be bad news for every company he runs but especially Tesla since it\u2019s publicly traded. Its value has been completely divorced from its products and profits for years now, and with Musk no longer at the helm, it\u2019s hard to imagine investors wouldn\u2019t flee. Tesla is Elon, and Elon is Tesla, after all.\nWhat\u2019s much more interesting to consider is what will happen to Tesla if we assume the status quo is mostly here to stay. In a situation where Trump loses, and Musk tries to go back to being his pre-Twitter-takeover self, it\u2019s still easy to see a lot of potential customers deciding they don\u2019t want to give their money to someone so unapologetically right-wing. I mean, he\u2019s already telling people he plans to crash the economy when he guts the federal government like a private equity CEO who just acquired a media company from Univision. Regular people don\u2019t tend to like guys like that.\nFor pretty much any other electric automaker, a Harris win would be good news. She will likely continue to offer tax credits for EV purchases and wants to grow the EV industry in the U.S. She\u2019ll invest in clean energy and will presumably continue the carbon credit program that benefits electric automakers, including Tesla. The bar isn\u2019t high, but you can expect Harris to be the most pro-EV president in history. On paper, Tesla\u2019s CEO should be all about that, especially with its U.S. factories giving it an advantage over automakers that build their EVs overseas.\nThe downside for Tesla is that Harris\u2019s policies will help the EV industry as a whole, not Tesla specifically. If other automakers\u2019 EV sales improve, that\u2019s only going to hurt Tesla\u2019s market share and will likely impact its sales, as well. What Tesla does have is its Supercharger network, which would still be a valuable asset that generates revenue even if every Tesla factory magically disappeared overnight.\nBy the end of the second Harris administration, other networks may have caught up, but at least in the near future, you can\u2019t overlook how important the Supercharger network is as the company faces an uphill battle against competition that only gets tougher every time a new EV goes on sale. The fact that Tesla\u2019s lineup is either ancient or the Cybertruck certainly doesn\u2019t help things, either.\nOf course, Musk defenders will tell you car sales don\u2019t matter because Tesla is now an AI/robotics company, but it\u2019s also easy to see investors getting spooked and trying to put their money somewhere safer than Tesla as they adjust their strategy based on the direction they believe Harris will take the country. It\u2019s also no secret that Tesla is a meme stock and has been for a long time. There may be a few credulous rubes who stick around and really believe Tesla is about to \u201csolve autonomy,\u201d but come late January, how many of those will still be around?\nIf investors get spooked, things could very quickly go from bad to worse for Musk and Tesla. SpaceX is valuable in terms of government contracts, but it isn\u2019t a publicly traded company he can use to fund his lifestyle. He needs Tesla to remain overvalued to keep this whole thing going, and a few big investors exiting could be the falling domino that eventually brings it all down. If the stock price is based on vibes anyway, bad vibes could easily snowball into a situation where everyone\u2019s desperate to jump ship before the price falls even further.\nIt\u2019s also not like the wealthy don\u2019t have valid reasons to be worried about an incoming Harris administration. She plans to raise taxes on the rich, regulate corporations and continue Biden\u2019s policy of going after wealthy tax cheats. (And miss me with that, \u201cWoe is me, I can barely get by on $400,000 in San Francisco,\u201d bullshit. Learn how to budget like the rest of us, Richy Rich.) The country and the people will be better off under the Harris administration, but even before she has the chance to do any of that, it wouldn\u2019t be surprising to see millionaires and billionaires act like the sky is falling because they might not be able to afford to outfit a new private jet or bust unions and abuse workers without consequences.\nAs a result, it\u2019s easy to imagine a scenario where investors want to distance themselves from Musk and put their money into safer investments that are less likely to be subject to increased regulation. And yet, once you get to that point, it really becomes hard to guess what happens next. Maybe it\u2019s possible that the board kicks Elon to the curb, goes back to being a regular electric automaker and gives up on pretending humanoid robots will actually be useful. Given the makeup of the current board, though, that seems about as likely as Musk getting actual prison time.",
