    "maintext": "Tesla\u2019s stock (TSLA) has surged to a $1 trillion valuation \u2013 seemingly over the assumption that the Trump and Musk relationship is going to benefit the automaker.\nThe company is virtually worth more than the next 10 biggest automakers combined.\nTesla has extended its post-election rally another 7% this morning \u2013 resulting in its valuation surpassing $1 trillion for the first time in years.\nThe company has long been the most valuable automaker in the world, but it is now worth more than the next 10 biggest automakers combined:\nConsidering there has been no significant news concerning Tesla this week other than the US elections, it\u2019s fairly clear that the latest rally is related to the election and the close relationship between Tesla CEO Elon Musk and President Elect Donald Trump.\nWhat is Trump going to do for Tesla?\nTesla added over $200 billion to its valuation since the election. That\u2019s a whole Toyota added to its valuation.\nWhat does justify that? What can Trump do that will help Tesla that much?\nIt\u2019s hard to tell exactly as what Trump says he will do and what he actually does aren\u2019t always the same things, but there are a few theories.\nThe President Elect made it clear that he wanted to remove the EV incentives that kept Tesla\u2019s sales from falling in the US over the last few years. This will make Tesla\u2019s vehicles more expensive, but some Tesla shareholders are hoping that it will cripple other EV competition, leaving Tesla alone in the future.\nThey are expecting something similar with the tariffs that Trump has been promising to impose on goods coming from other countries.\nThe auto industry is globalized and US automakers rely on parts from other countries, but on average, Tesla is more vertically integrated than other automakers.\nWhile all automotive costs are likely to go up, Tesla investors believe the company will be able to stomach the tariffs better than the competition.\nFinally, on the automotive manufacturing front, there\u2019s also the more conspiratorial theory that Trump could carve out exceptions built especially for Tesla now that Musk has his ear.\nWhile automotive manufacturing is still the bulk of Tesla\u2019s business, Musk was clear that he believes that \u201cTesla is worth nothing without self-driving.\u201d Trump can\u2019t help Tesla achieve self-driving, but Musk has hinted that he could build a federal framework to get self-driving systems approve at the federal level rather than state-by-state.\nThis would help Tesla more easily roll out when/if it solves self-driving.\nElectrek\u2019s Take\nThey have some good points about Tesla being more competitive than other EV automakers in a harsher cost environment.\nTesla has already proved it during the supply chain crisis amid the pandemic.\nMy problem with it is that it\u2019s not good for electric vehicles. It\u2019s only good for Tesla. At Electrek, we are for the acceleration of EV adoption in order to help ensure the transportation and energy industries are on an accelerated path to sustainability.\nTesla used to be for that too.\nWithin a scenario where EV incentives are removed and automotive costs increase due to tariffs, EV adoption goes down in the US. Electric vehicles will be more expensive at the sticker price and historically, that has always resulted in fewer sales.\nIt\u2019s going to be true of Tesla and all other EV automakers. The only way you can see that as been good for Tesla is if that kills the other automakers and only Tesla survives.\nThat\u2019s a real possibilities, but it would be bad for the mission to accelerate electric transportation.\nIt goes against Tesla\u2019s original mission, which was to accelerate the entire industry\u2019s transition.\nIn a way, it feels like Tesla was early and took advantage of the incentives and as other companies are trying to catch up, Tesla, or rather Musk, aims to close the door behind them. This goes against the original mission.\nIf that\u2019s really what is going on, Tesla is not mission driven anymore. It has become all about the stock.",
