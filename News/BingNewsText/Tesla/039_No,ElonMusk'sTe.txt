    "maintext": "Despite what content farms on YouTube and other platforms want you to believe, Elon Musk\u2019s Tesla (TSLA) is not buying Ford Motor Co. (F)\nAlthough it should really go without saying that Musk is not buying Ford, the Detroit automaker has confirmed that the rumor is entirely made up. \u201cNo, that\u2019s not true,\u201d a spokesperson told The Houston Chronicle on Friday.\nRumors about Tesla making big acquisitions are always floating around the internet, although some of the latest are mainly generated by artificial intelligence rather than usual gossip. There\u2019s a mini-cottage industry of fake Tesla news and gossip all over YouTube and likely other corners of the internet.\nBoth Elon Musk Rewind and Voyager, which appear to be either the source of or a transmitter of the idea that Musk is buying Ford, have spread a number of false claims. That includes fake products, like a \u201cTesla Home\u201d and $500 laptops, or claims that Musk has found \u201cproof\u201d that giants are alive. For what it\u2019s worth, Elon Musk Rewind does in its video\u2019s description that it \u201ccontains information not to be considered the truth.\u201d\nOther channels claim that Tesla is buying Jeep-maker Stellantis to \u201call competition,\u201d releasing hydrogen-powered cars, and other obvious falsehoods.\nIt\u2019s plain to see why such channels would make up content about Musk \u2014 he\u2019s kind of a big deal. With President-elect Donald Trump heading to the White House, Musk is poised to have a sizable amount of influence over him, as well as an undefined role in slashing government spending. That\u2019s already paying dividends, sending Tesla stock surging and its market cap past $1 trillion last week.\nBesides Tesla, which makes electric vehicles and works on self-driving cars, Musk already owns or leads several companies. That includes aerospace firm SpaceX, the social media platform X (META), artificial intelligence startup xAI, brain chip startup Neuralink, and tunneling firm The Boring Company.",
