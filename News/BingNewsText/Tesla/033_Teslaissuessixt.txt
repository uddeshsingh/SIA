    "maintext": "Tesla\u2019s Cybertruck is facing its sixth recall since its launch a year ago.\nThe recall affects 2,431 units, including certain 2024 Cybertrucks built between November 6, 2023 and July 30, 2024. A report from Tesla found that those trucks are or were equipped with a faulty drive inverter.\n\u201cIf the inverter stops producing torque, the driver loses the ability to apply torque to the vehicle using the accelerator pedal resulting in a loss of propulsion, which may increase the risk of a collision,\u201d reads Tesla\u2019s report.\nIn October, Tesla recalled 27,185 Cybertrucks due to a delay in the rearview camera image that could impair driver visibility. Unlike that recall, which required an over-the-air update, Tesla will need to physically replace the recalled drive inverter, which the EV-maker said it would do free of charge.",
