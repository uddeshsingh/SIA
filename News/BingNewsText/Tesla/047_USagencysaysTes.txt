    "maintext": "DETROIT (AP) \u2014 The U.S. government\u2019s highway safety agency says Tesla is telling drivers in public statements that its vehicles can drive themselves, conflicting with owners manuals and briefings with the agency saying the electric vehicles need human supervision.\nThe National Highway Traffic Safety Administration is asking the company to \u201crevisit its communications\u201d to make sure messages are consistent with user instructions.\nThe request came in a May email to the company from Gregory Magno, a division chief with the agency\u2019s Office of Defects Investigation. It was attached to a letter seeking information on a probe into crashes involving Tesla\u2019s \u201cFull Self-Driving\u201d system in low-visibility conditions. The letter was posted Friday on the agency\u2019s website.\nThe agency began the investigation in October after getting reports of four crashes involving \u201cFull Self-Driving\u201d when Teslas encountered sun glare, fog and airborne dust. An Arizona pedestrian was killed in one of the crashes.\nCritics, including Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, have long accused Tesla of using deceptive names for its partially automated driving systems, including \u201cFull Self-Driving\u201d and \u201cAutopilot,\u201d both of which have been viewed by owners as fully autonomous.\nThe letter and email raise further questions about whether Full Self-Driving will be ready for use without human drivers on public roads, as Tesla CEO Elon Musk has predicted. Much of Tesla\u2019s stock valuation hinges on the company deploying a fleet of autonomous robotaxis.\nMusk, who has promised autonomous vehicles before, said the company plans to have autonomous Models Y and 3 running without human drivers next year. Robotaxis without steering wheels would be available in 2026 starting in California and Texas, he said.\nA message was sent Friday seeking comment from Tesla.\nIn the email, Magno writes that Tesla briefed the agency in April on an offer of a free trial of \u201cFull Self-Driving\u201d and emphasized that the owner\u2019s manual, user interface and a YouTube video tell humans that they have to remain vigilant and in full control of their vehicles.\nBut Magno cited seven posts or reposts by Tesla\u2019s account on X, the social media platform owned by Musk, that Magno said indicated that Full Self-Driving is capable of driving itself.\n\u201cTesla\u2019s X account has reposted or endorsed postings that exhibit disengaged driver behavior,\u201d Magno wrote. \u201cWe believe that Tesla\u2019s postings conflict with its stated messaging that the driver is to maintain continued control over the dynamic driving task.\u201d\nThe postings may encourage drivers to see Full Self-Driving, which now has the word \u201csupervised\u201d next to it in Tesla materials, to view the system as a \u201cchauffeur or robotaxi rather than a partial automation/driver assist system that requires persistent attention and intermittent intervention by the driver,\u201d Magno wrote.\nOn April 11, for instance, Tesla reposted a story about a man who used Full Self-Driving to travel 13 miles (21 kilometers) from his home to an emergency room during a heart attack just after the free trial began on April 1. A version of Full Self-Driving helped the owner \u201cget to the hospital when he needed immediate medical attention,\u201d the post said.\nIn addition, Tesla says on its website that use of Full Self-Driving and Autopilot without human supervision depends on \u201cachieving reliability\u201d and regulatory approval, Magno wrote. But the statement is accompanied by a video of a man driving on local roads with his hands on his knees, with a statement that, \u201cThe person in the driver\u2019s seat is only there for legal reasons. He is not doing anything. The car is driving itself,\u201d the email said.\nIn the letter seeking information on driving in low-visibility conditions, Magno wrote that the investigation will focus on the system\u2019s ability to perform in low-visibility conditions caused by \u201crelatively common traffic occurrences.\u201d\nDrivers, he wrote, may not be told by the car that they should decide where Full Self-Driving can safely operate or fully understand the capabilities of the system.\n\u201cThis investigation will consider the adequacy of feedback or information the system provides to drivers to enable them to make a decision in real time when the capability of the system has been exceeded,\u201d Magno wrote.\nThe letter asks Tesla to describe all visual or audio warnings that drivers get that the system \u201cis unable to detect and respond to any reduced visibility condition.\u201d\nThe agency gave Tesla until Dec. 18 to respond to the letter, but the company can ask for an extension.\nThat means the investigation is unlikely to be finished by the time President-elect Donald Trump takes office in January, and Trump has said he would put Musk in charge of a government efficiency commission to audit agencies and eliminate fraud. Musk spent at least $119 million in a campaign to get Trump elected, and Trump has spoken against government regulations.\nAuto safety advocates fear that if Musk gains some control over NHTSA, the Full Self-Driving and other investigations into Tesla could be derailed.\nMusk even floated the idea of him helping to develop national safety standards for self-driving vehicles.\n\u201cOf course the fox wants to build the henhouse,\u201d said Michael Brooks, executive director of the Center for Auto Safety, a nonprofit watchdog group.\nHe added that he can\u2019t think of anyone who would agree that a business mogul should have direct involvement in regulations that affect the mogul\u2019s companies.\n\u201cThat\u2019s a huge problem for democracy, really,\u201d Brooks said.",
