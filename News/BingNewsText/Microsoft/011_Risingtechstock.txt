    "maintext": "Technology stocks pulled Wall Street to another record amid a mixed Monday of trading.\nThe Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 rose 0.2% from its all-time high set on Friday to post a record for the 54th time this year. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 128 points, or 0.3%, while the Nasdaq composite gained 1%.\nSuper Micro Computer, a stock that\u2019s been on an AI-driven roller coaster, soared 28.7% to lead the market.\nFollowing allegations of misconduct and the resignation of its public auditor, the maker of servers used in artificial intelligence technology said an investigation found no evidence of misconduct by its management or by the company\u2019s board. It also said that it doesn\u2019t expect to restate its past financials and that it will find a new chief financial officer, appoint a general counsel and make other moves to strengthen its governance.\nBig Tech stocks also helped prop up the market. Gains of 1.8% for Microsoft and 3.2% for Meta Platforms were the two strongest forces pushing upward on the S&P 500.\nIntel was another propellant during the morning, but it lost an early gain to fall 0.5% after the chip company said Chief Executive Pat Gelsinger has retired and stepped down from the board. Intel is looking for Gelsinger\u2019s replacement, and its chair said it\u2019s \u201ccommitted to restoring investor confidence.\u201d Intel recently lost its spot in the Dow Jones Industrial Average to Nvidia, which has skyrocketed in Wall Street\u2019s frenzy around AI.\nStellantis, meanwhile, skidded following the announcement of its CEO\u2019s departure. Carlos Tavares steps down after nearly four years in the top spot of the automaker, which owns car brands Jeep, Citro\u00ebn and Ram, amid an ongoing struggle with slumping sales and an inventory backlog at dealerships. The world\u2019s fourth-largest automaker\u2019s stock fell 6.3% in Milan.\nThe majority of stocks in the S&P 500 likewise fell, including California utility PG&E. It dropped 5% after saying it would sell $2.4 billion of stock and preferred shares to raise cash.\nRetailers were mixed amid what\u2019s expected to be the best Cyber Monday on record and coming off Black Friday. Target, which recently gave a forecast for the holiday season that left investors discouraged, fell 1.2%. Walmart, which gave a more optimistic forecast, rose 0.2%.\nAmazon, which looks to benefit from online sales from Cyber Monday, climbed 1.4%.\nAll told, the S&P 500 added 14.77 points to 6,047.15. The Dow fell 128.65 to 44,782.00, and the Nasdaq composite climbed 185.78 to 19,403.95.\nThe stock market largely took Donald Trump\u2019s latest threat on tariffs in stride. The president-elect on Saturday threatened 100% tariffs against a group of developing economies if they act to undermine the U.S. dollar. Trump said he wants the group, headlined by Brazil, Russia, India and China, to promise it won\u2019t create a new currency or otherwise try to undercut the U.S. dollar.\nThe dollar has long been the currency of choice for global trade. Speculation has also been around a long time that other currencies could knock it off its mantle, but no contender has come close.\nThe U.S. dollar\u2019s value rose Monday against several other currencies, but one of its strongest moves likely had less to do with the tariff threats. The euro fell amid a political battle in Paris over the French government\u2019s budget. The euro sank 0.7% against the U.S. dollar and broke below $1.05.\nIn the bond market, Treasury yields gave up early gains to hold relatively steady. The yield on the 10-year Treasury climbed above 4.23% during the morning before falling back to 4.19%. That was just above its level of 4.18% late Friday.\nA report in the morning showed the U.S. manufacturing sector contracted again last month, but not by as much as economists expected.\nThis upcoming week will bring several big updates on the job market, including the October job openings report, weekly unemployment benefits data and the all-important November jobs report. They could steer the next moves for the Federal Reserve, which recently began pulling interest rates lower to give support to the economy.\nEconomists expect Friday\u2019s headliner report to show U.S. employers accelerated their hiring in November, coming off October\u2019s lackluster growth that was hampered by damaging hurricanes and strikes.\n\u201cWe now find ourselves in the middle of this Goldilocks zone, where economic health supports earnings growth while remaining weak enough to justify potential Fed rate cuts,\u201d according to Mark Hackett, chief of investment research at Nationwide.\nIn financial markets abroad, Chinese stocks led gains worldwide as monthly surveys showed improving conditions for manufacturing, partly driven by a surge in orders ahead of Trump\u2019s inauguration next month.\nBoth official and private sector surveys of factory managers showed strong new orders and export orders, possibly partly linked to efforts by importers in the U.S. to beat potential tariff hikes by Trump once he takes office.\nIndexes rose 0.7% in Hong Kong and 1.1% in Shanghai.",
