    "maintext": "ChatGPT opened the floodgates. But many people don\u2019t realize there\u2019s a whole world of generative AI tools and applications out there, just waiting to be explored.\nWhether you\u2019re struggling to overcome a case of writer\u2019s block, lack the artistic aptitude to do your imagination justice, or just need a hand crafting efficient computer code, generative AI can help augment and streamline both your professional and creative endeavors. Yet, amid the seemingly endless variety of AI assistants currently on offer, finding the right one for your needs can prove a daunting task. So, let\u2019s delve into some of the most impressive AI tools that are pushing the boundaries of innovation, including the best AI chatbots, the best AI image generators, and much more.\nRecommended Videos\nThe best AI tools for image generation\nMidjourney\nOne of the first AI image generators to be released back in 2022, Midjourney has proven immensely popular with users and art critics alike. It can output high-definition, photorealistic images in countless artistic styles based on natural language text prompts.\nOriginally only available through the company\u2019s Discord server, Midjourney can now be accessed through a streamlined web portal. While the website\u2019s gallery of generated art is free to browse, you will need to subscribe to a monthly service plan (which range from $10 to $120) in order to generate images of your own.\nIdeogram\nWhile not as creatively robust as Midjourney \u2014 only able to generate images in one of five preset artistic styles \u2014 Ideogram does offer a generous free tier that allows users to generate up to 40 images per day. Paid tiers range from $7 to $48 per month and offer a host of benefits, from additional compute resources and priority access to full-quality image downloads. The company also boasts an iOS app and an API that it claims will \u201coffer superior image quality at a lower cost compared to other models.\u201d\nDall-E 3\nThis is OpenAI\u2019s in-house text-to-image generator and runs atop the company\u2019s GPT-4 model. Originally released in September 2023, it was initially only available to paid tier subscribers. OpenAI expanded its availability to free tier users this past August, though you\u2019ll only be able to generate two images per day at that subscription level. Dall-E 3 is also available through Microsoft\u2019s Copilot chatbot.\nImagen 3\nIf you\u2019re looking to create high-quality images without the strict production limits that ChatGPT enforces, Google\u2019s Imagen 3 is a solid option. It\u2019s available through the Gemini chatbot, including the free tier, and offers higher-quality outputs with fewer artifacts than its previous versions. Note, however, that the system will not generate images of people, famous or not, unless you subscribe to Gemini Advanced (which costs $20 per month).\nGrok 2\nGrok 2 is the text-to-image generator for people uninterested in adhering to copyright law. Developed for Elon Musk\u2019s xAI company, and available on X, Grok 2 isn\u2019t restricted by minor inconveniences like safety and legal guardrails, as other image generators are. Want to see Mickey Mouse fighting Darth Vader atop a 747 as it flies into the World Trade Center? Grok will generate it, no questions asked. You will, however, need to pony up $8 for a premium subscription to X in order to access it.\nGen 3 Alpha with Frames\nRunway\u2019s Gen 3 Alpha is a relatively new model, having been released in June of 2024, and is capable of creating both still images and video clips with nearly photorealistic quality based on the user\u2019s natural language prompts. The company recently announced that it will begin integrating a new foundational model, dubbed Frames, into the Gen 3 platform that will offer unprecedented control over the image creation process, enabling users to generate multiple image variants while maintaining a specific aesthetic style, whether that\u2019s mimicking 35mm disposable camera shots or retro anime motifs. Subscription prices run from $12 to $76 per month, though the company does offer a limited free tier as well.\nThe best AI tools for image editing\nLuminar Neo\nSkylum\u2019s Luminar Neo is a photo editing suite designed with professional photographers in mind. It offers many of the same powerful tools as Adobe Photoshop, but outsources much of their functionality to AI. This enables users to accomplish numerous common tasks, from adjusting color balance and lighting levels to tweaking the look of the sky, water, and skin tones, with a single click. Luminar Neo might be a bit pricey for casual users, costing $421 for a yearly subscription or as a lifetime subscription for $577. It\u2019s available on both Windows and Mac, as well as a plugin for Photoshop, Photos, and Lightroom.\nCanva Pro\nCanva is a multifunction creative platform that offers everything from digital whiteboarding, data visualization, and marketing material templates to photo, video, and YouTube editing features. While you can easily make minor adjustments like cropping, adding filters and adjusting aspect ratios using the site\u2019s free editor, Canva Pro offers a number of additional AI-empowered tools.\nSelect, move, resize, and even erase individual objects within an image; extract and modify text on flattened images; and even generatively expand the image\u2019s background, all with a few simple clicks. Canva Pro costs $120 per year for a single user license.\nPixlr Suite\nThis online photo editing suite has served as a free and user-friendly alternative to Photoshop since it was released in 2008. Last November, the company debuted a number of AI features including image generation, a generative fill tool, AI background removal, AI face swap, and image expansion to help round out the tool set\u2019s functionality. While the interface is geared more for casual users and may not be as precise and granular as what Photoshop offers, you can\u2019t beat free.\nTopaz Photo AI\nIf you only need to do some light retouching work on your images, the Topaz Photo AI suite offers eight enhancement tools: Denoise, Sharpen, Upscale, Recover Faces, Remove Objects, Preserve Text, Adjust Lighting, and Balance Color. It\u2019s not a true replacement for full-function photo editors like Photoshop, but it is available without an annual subscription, for a flat rate of just $199 with version upgrades costing $99.\nFirefly AI\nAdobe\u2019s Firefly AI doesn\u2019t just generate images and video from text prompts, it also empowers a number of AI features throughout the Adobe product ecosystem. That includes the Generative Fill tool in Photoshop, text effects in Adobe Express, vector and pattern generation in Illustrator, and Generative Extend in Premiere Pro. You will need to subscribe to Adobe\u2019s Creative Cloud suite in order to access these features, though they can either be purchased individually (the image generator, for example, costs $5/month while Photoshop costs $23) or you can pick up all 20-plus Adobe apps for $60 per month.\nBest AI for video generation\nLuma Dream Machine\nWhile Luma Dream Machine may be designed with fashion, marketing and filmmaking professionals in mind, it\u2019s built as a subscription-based service with both casual and professional users in mind. Unlike conventional AI tools, Dream Machine does not require precise and exhaustive prompting to generate the desired effect, but rather, interprets the user\u2019s natural language request intuitively. It also accepts multi-image prompting and single-image character references so users can show the AI what they have in mind. Luma does not offer a free tier, though a \u201chobbyist\u201d subscription costs just $10 per month.\nKling\nKling AI video-generation system from China\u2019s Kuaishou Technology offers photorealistic outputs on par with what we\u2019ve seen from OpenAI\u2019s Sora and is already available to users around the world. It can generate high-definition videos up to two minutes in length (double what Sora can) at up to 30 frames per second and 720p resolutions (slightly less than Sora\u2019s 1080p output). Each clip starts out at just five seconds in length but can be extended in 4.5-second increments by purchasing additional credits. Just be warned that the system is blocked from generating politically-sensitive subjects.\nSynthesia\nSynthesia is a bit more niche than the other video generators we\u2019ve discussed so far. It\u2019s designed specifically to generate video avatars from the user\u2019s text prompts making it ideal for business applications like onboarding and training videos, sales presentations, and internal communications. Users can choose from one of more than 130 avatar models speaking 140 different languages and over 60 video templates. The free tier allows you to generate a single three-minute video per month and your choice of nine avatars, while the $30/month Starter tier and $90/month creator tier offer significantly more benefits.\nVyond\nVyond offers similar functionality to Synthesia in that it generates AI avatars for training videos based on the user\u2019s text prompts, however, this service relies on animated characters rather than live actors. You also have the option to record yourself performing specific actions or movements and Vyond will motion match its animation to them. Plans start at $49 per month, which also includes access to an added video editor, though anything you produce at that tier will be watermarked with Vyond\u2019s logo.\nThe best AI for text generation\nChatGPT\nChatGPT, the chatbot that launched the AI boom in 2022, remains at the forefront of the industry with an estimated 200 million active weekly users. Trained on huge quantities of written content including websites, books, social media posts, and news articles, ChatGPT is equally adept at answering general knowledge queries and compiling computer code as it is at generating creative prose. It was also the first chatbot to offer a conversational feature in Advanced Voice Mode that allows users to interact with the chatbot as if it were a person, doing away with the need for text-based prompts.\nChatGPT is available on the web as well as on iOS and Android. It\u2019s free to use, though subscribing to the $20/month ChatGPT-Plus plan will give you increased access to the company\u2019s latest AI models and features.\nCopilot\nCopilot answers the question \u201cwhat if ChatGPT worked natively within Microsoft\u2019s 365 app ecosystem?\u201d Which is exactly what it does. Microsoft has invested billions in OpenAI\u2019s business and, as such, its Copilot AI runs atop the startup\u2019s GPT-4o LLM.\nHowever, Copilot is more than just a reskinned ChatGPT. For one, Copilot does not restrict users from generating images without paying for a subscription to its premium plan as ChatGPT does. For another, its functionality can be integrated across Microsoft\u2019s products, helping users generate text in Word, create graphs and tables in Excel, and draft emails in Outlook.\nGoogle Gemini\nGoogle\u2019s Gemini chatbot may have gotten off to a bit of a rocky start upon its official debut in February but the AI assistant has quickly grown into a potent rival to ChatGPT, offering much of the same functions and features. Those include the ability to generate text, images, video, audio, and code, converse with users verbally with Gemini Live, and integrate with Google\u2019s Workspace app suite. It can gin up email responses in Gmail, search for files in Drive, create content for Slides, and draft text in Docs, all through the user\u2019s natural language prompts.\nGemini is free to use and is available on the web as well as through its iOS and Android apps, but if you want to access the AI\u2019s more advanced features (and Workspace integrations), you\u2019ll need to subscribe to the company\u2019s $20/month Google One AI Premium service.\nPerplexity\nPerplexity\u2019s AI assistant offers a unique alternative to traditional search engines. Rather than simply return a list of websites in response to a user\u2019s query as Google search does, this chatbot scours the internet for relevant information, then synthesizes an answer to the user\u2019s question directly in the chat window. It essentially eliminates the need to click through to individual websites to find the information you\u2019re looking for.\nBuilt atop the GPT-4 model and available on Android, iOS, as well as on the web, Perplexity is free to use. The company also offers a Pro subscription plan for $20/month (or $200/year) that grants you access to additional AI models including GPT-4 Omni and Claude 3 Sonnet and Haiku, as well as a host of additional benefits.\nJasper\nUnlike generalized chatbots like ChatGPT and Gemini, Jasper AI is all business. It is designed to generate text for emails, blogs, social media posts, and marketing materials, all while maintaining your company\u2019s distinctive tone, voice, and brand style. The platform includes Jasper Chat, which assists with research tasks and offers writing advice, as well as can help maximize the SEO score of your marketing content. Jasper is only available on a subscription basis, with plans starting at $40 per month per user, though the company does offer a seven-day trial.\nThe best AI for audio and voice generation\nElevenLabs\nElevenLabs knows how to make a machine talk. The company is a leader in generative speech technology, offering a variety of audio-centric services from automatic voice dubbing and cloning to text-to-speech and text-to-SFX. Users can select from thousands of unique voices (including those of famous celebrities), all trained on public domain and licensed data, in any of 32 languages. Ideal for podcasting, audio book narration, and conversational AI applications, the company\u2019s products are available at a variety of pricing tiers ranging from free up to $99 per month.\nSpeechify\nWhy read a document when you can have Speechify read it to you four and a half times faster? The company\u2019s voiceover technology can recite nearly any document you present to it in one of 200 voices (including your own through its voice cloning feature) in more than 60 languages. Speechify is available as a Chrome extension, a Mac app, a web app, iOS or Android app. The mobile apps can also read physical documents using your phone\u2019s camera to scan the page. Speechify\u2019s free tier limits you to simple text-to-speech in just 10 voices, while the $12/month premium tier unlocks the service\u2019s full functionality.\nRespeecher\nRespeecher specializes in voice cloning for celebrities, content creators, voice actors, game designers, and other professional applications. The company\u2019s AI model essentially enables one person to speak in the voice of another. \u201cWe take recordings of the \u2018target voice\u2019 (the voice that is being replicated), train our system, and apply it to a \u2018source speaker\u2019 (the actor reading the lines),\u201d the Respeecher\u2019s FAQ explains. \u201cIt features all the emotions, intonations, and nuances of a real human voice.\u201d\nThe company offers a wide range of celebrity voices including Chris Farley and Richard Nixon, the latter of which earned Speechify an Emmy in 2019. Subscription plans start at $18 per month for basic text-to-speech (up to 100,000 characters per month and range up to $500 per month for the Power tier, which offers 900 minutes of speech-to-speech and 3 million characters of text-to-speech generation in more than 100 voices and 13 accents.\nControlla Voice\nIf you fancy yourself a musician but can\u2019t carry a tune, Controlla Voice can help. Its generative model can train an \u201cAI Singing Voice\u201d that sounds like you, based on 15-30 minutes of sample audio, then apply it to songs from the company\u2019s extensive catalog, or blend your voice with others from their licensed stable of voice actors to generate unique vocals. You can even convert the vocals in existing songs from other artists into your voice for low-effort covers. Subscription prices run from $12 to $30 per month.\nThe best AI for coding\nClaude\nAnthropic\u2019s Claude chatbot may not be able to generate images or speak to you conversationally, but it utterly excels at coding applications. Its latest iteration, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, drastically outperforms the likes of Gemini 1.5 Pro and ChatGPT-4o across a broad swath of leading industry benchmarks. Claude was also the first chatbot to offer a collaborative window (dubbed Artifacts) that previews what the AI is generating outside of the chat stream. The chatbot is available free to all users on the web, iOS, and Android, though subscribing to the $20/month Pro or $30/month Teams tiers will grant you priority access to the latest and greatest models that Anthropic has to offer.\nGitHub Copilot\nDeveloped through a partnership between Github and OpenAI, GitHub Copilot acts as an AI autocomplete, to help users in the Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, Neovim, and JetBrains IDEs generate code faster than they can on their own. Users can present Copilot with a coding problem, phrased in natural language, and the assistant will automatically generate a solution code. Conversely, it can also explain what a given snippet of code does as well as convert snippets between various coding languages. You can use Github Copilot for free, though upgrading to either the $4/month Pro or $21/month Enterprise tiers will, of course, give you additional resources and features.\nAmazon CodeWhisperer\nSimilar to Copilot, Amazon\u2019s CodeWhisperer is a general use coding assistant that will automatically generate suggestions and code recommendations based on your existing inputs, in real time. It\u2019s available for the JetBrains and Visual Studio IDEs and also supports natural language-to-bash translation in the Mac command line. The free tier only offers limited access to the system\u2019s more advanced features, so you\u2019ll have to pony up $20/month if you want to unlock its full capabilities.\nCursor AI\nCursor AI is a coding assistant in the same vein as Codewhisperer but can offer autocomplete suggestions across multiple lines of code, based on your previous inputs. It also offers a smart rewrite function that automatically corrects your typos and syntax errors so you spend less time tracking down errant quotation marks and parentheses while debugging, as well as cursor prediction that guesses where your cursor needs to be next, enabling you to navigate through your project faster and more efficiently.\nIt even offers a chatbot assistant (leveraging GPT-4, GPT-4o, and Claude 3.5 Sonnet) that can answer questions about either the entire active file or specific selected code blocks. The chatbot can even edit that highlighted code based on your natural language instructions. Cursor AI is available for the Mac, Windows, and Linux operating systems. You can try it out free for two weeks before a $20/month Pro or $40/user/month Business subscription is required.\nThe best AI to integrate with the rest of your app ecosystem\nMeta AI\nMeta, Facebook\u2019s parent company, has been investing heavily in AI over the past few years and has recently begun incorporating the smart features found in rivals like Gemini and Copilot to its own product portfolio. \u201cMore than 400 million people are using Meta AI monthly, with 185 million people using it across our products each week,\u201d the company boasted in a September blog post.\nThe company now offers a conversational AI similar to Advanced Voice Mode in Messenger, Facebook, WhatsApp, and Instagram DM. It can answer questions about photos shared in your group chats, generate custom backgrounds for images you reshare from your feed to Instagram Stories, and automatically translate the audio of your Instagram Reels. It can also generate images to share on your feed, Stories, and set as your Facebook profile picture. So when you find yourself wondering why there\u2019s so much AI slop clogging up Facebook and Insta, understand that it is a feature Meta has spent billions developing, not a bug.\n365 Copilot\nMicrosoft has dumped north of $10 billion into its partnership with OpenAI, so of course it\u2019s going to shoehorn ChatGPT\u2019s generative capabilities into every single product it possibly can. In addition to the Copilot chatbot itself, Microsoft has developed and released Copilot Pages, which function much like Claude\u2019s Artifacts or ChatGPT\u2019s Canvas. The company has also integrated it into Outlook to help you manage your inbox by prioritizing which messages to respond to first and quickly draft email replies.\n365 Copilot can also help you rapidly establish a cohesive narrative in your PowerPoint presentations by generating pitch decks whole cloth from your natural language prompt that maintain a consistent tone and brand voice. In Excel, Copilot does the heavy lifting of generating formulas, graphs, and charts based, again, on the user\u2019s prompt. And in Teams, Copilot can monitor your video meetings and provide summaries of what happened as well as generate actionable item lists based on what was discussed.\nGoogle Gemini\nGemini does for Google\u2019s Workspace app suite what Copilot does for Microsoft\u2019s. The AI assistant can help draft emails in Gmail, write documents in Docs, generate graphs and charts in Sheets, create and modify slides in Slides, find files in Drive, and provide live-translated captions and take notes in Meet. If you don\u2019t already have a personal Google One AI Premium subscription, you\u2019ll have to ask your Workspace admin to grant you access.\nApple Intelligence",
