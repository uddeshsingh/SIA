    "maintext": "A Microsoft 365 subscription includes Microsoft Word for writing, PowerPoint for creating presentations, Outlook for email and OneDrive for cloud storage. Whether for work, school, personal use or all of the above, chances are you\u2019ll want access to these apps -- we definitely find them helpful.\nA paid Microsoft 365 membership normally starts at $2 a month or $20 a year for Microsoft 365 Basic tier, so you\u2019ll shell out anywhere from $20 to $100 annually, depending on the plan. While a few bucks a month may not sound too bank-breaking, subscription services can add up. Thankfully, you can get Microsoft 365 at no cost if you're a student or teacher. Even if you don't have a school email address, you can still use Microsoft 365 without paying by taking advantage of a free trial or relying on the zero-dollar but limited functionality of online-only versions of apps like Word, meaning anybody with internet access to a free version of Microsoft 365.\nWhether you're a student, teacher, budget-conscious shopper or all of the above, here\u2019s how you can get Microsoft 365 for free.\nStudents and teachers can get Microsoft Office 365 Education for free with a school email address\nIf you're a student, teacher or faculty member with an active school email address, then you're probably eligible to get access to Office 365 for free through Microsoft. An Office 365 Education subscription provides access to Word, Excel, PowerPoint, OneNote and Teams, plus other classroom tools.\nAll you have to do is punch in your school email address on this page on Microsoft's website: Office 365 Education. In many cases, you'll be instantly granted access thanks to an automated verification process. If you attend an institution that needs to be verified, it might take up to a month to confirm your eligibility.\nCollege students can also get Microsoft 365 Personal for $3 a month with a valid school email address -- that's a considerable savings when compared with the standard $7 a month ($70 a year) price for non-students.\nIf you're not affiliated with an academic institution, you can use Microsoft 365 without paying using online-only apps or via a free trial\nNot everyone can take advantage of an email address through an academic institution to get the Microsoft Office suite at no cost. Thankfully, anyone can get a one-month free trial of Microsoft 365. You do need to enter a credit card number. If you don't cancel your subscription before the month is up, you'll be charged $100 for a one-year subscription to Microsoft 365 Family (formerly called Office 365 Home).\nThe good news is that you can access a number of apps online for free, including Word, Excel, PowerPoint, OneDrive, Outlook, Calendar, My Content, Skype, Designer and Clipchamp as long as you don't need the full suite of Microsoft 365 tools. Here's how to activate Microsoft 365 for free:\n1. Go to Microsoft365.com.\n2. Click Sign up for the free version of Office under the \"Sign in\" button.\n3. Log in to your Microsoft account or create one for free. If you already have a Windows, Skype or Xbox Live login, you have an active Microsoft account.\n4. Select the app you want to use and save your work in the cloud with OneDrive.\nWait, what's the catch with the free version?\nYou might be thinking, \"If I can get all of those apps for free, why pay for Microsoft 365 in the first place?\" The functionality of the free apps is limited, so they only run in your web browser and you can only use them while you're actively connected to the internet -- there\u2019s no offline version. They also have fewer features than the full Microsoft 365 versions. For instance, Microsoft Teams calls are limited to group calls of 100 participants for 60 minutes per month with the free app, and calls of up to 300 participants with a 30 hour monthly allowance for the paid version of Microsoft 365 Personal or Family.\nFor most folks, those limitations should still give them more than enough to work with. However, for more demanding situations, like small businesses and classroom settings, you may need to pay for a full account or snag a free copy of Microsoft 365 using a school email address.\nThere are still benefits to the free version of Microsoft 365, including the ability to share links to your work and collaborate in real-time, similar to what the Google Workspace (formerly G Suite) productivity tools allow. If you're looking for basic versions of each of these apps, the free version should work well for you.",
