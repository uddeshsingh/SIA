    "maintext": "What you need to know\nCrash Team Racing Nitro-Fueled first launched on Xbox One, PlayStation 4, and Nintendo Switch back on June 21, 2019.\nDeveloped by Beenox, it's a heavily remastered version of the original Crash Team Racing developed by Naughty Dog in 1999.\nCrash Team Racing Nitro-Fueled is joining the Xbox Game Pass lineup on Dec. 4, 2024.\nA handful of other Activision Blizzard games from the company's catalogue have been added to Xbox Game Pass in recent months, including Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3, Crash Bandicoot N. Sane Trilogy, and the Spyro Reignited Trilogy.\nThis year's time is waning, but there's still more games headed to Microsoft's gaming subscription service.\nThe official Xbox Game Pass X (Twitter) account shared on Monday that players can soon look forward to Crash Team Racing Nitro-Fueled joining the service on Dec. 4, 2024. First launching in June 2019, Crash Team Racing Nitro-Fueled is a remaster of Naughty Dog's original Crash Team Racing. This remastered effort was developed by Beenox, a team that often provides support work on other Activision Blizzard titles, including the Call of Duty franchise.\nCrash Team Racing launched on Xbox One, PlayStation 4, and Nintendo Switch, though oddly enough, no PC version was ever released. The game has not been updated for modern gaming consoles, meaning it still runs at 30 FPS on all platforms.\n\ud83d\udd25The hottest Cyber Monday deals\ud83d\udd25\n\ud83c\udfaeLenovo Legion Go (Z1 Extreme) | $472.97 at Amazon (Save $227!)\n\ud83d\udd79\ufe0fXbox Game Pass Ultimate (3-months) | $27.99 at CDKeys (Save $12!)\n\ud83c\udfaeASUS ROG Ally (Z1) | $349.99 at Best Buy (Save $150!)\n\ud83d\udedcXbox Series X Digital Edition (1TB) | $399.99 at Best Buy (Save $50!)\n\ud83d\udda5\ufe0fBeelink Mini PC (Ryzen 5) | $279 at Amazon (Save $70!)\n\ud83e\udd7dMeta Quest 3 (512GB) + free game | $499 at Best Buy (Save $150!)\nClosing out 2024 with more Activision Blizzard games\nAfter Microsoft finished its acquisition of Activision Blizzard King in October 2023, it took some time for any benefits to filter down to players.\nTop Xbox recommendations\n- Best Xbox headsets to get in 2024\n- Best upcoming Xbox games\n- Best gaming laptops in 2024\n- Best Xbox controller deals\n- Best Xbox hard drives\n- Best Xbox SSDs\nOver the last few months, games from Activision Blizzard's library have been very slowly but very steadily added to Game Pass at an ever-so-softly increasing pace, including Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3, Crash Bandicoot N. Sane Trilogy, Spyro Reignited Trilogy, and even StarCraft and StarCraft 2. Activision also launched its first-ever game on Xbox Game Pass to smashing early success with Call of Duty: Black Ops 6.\nCrash Team Racing Nitro-Fueled is likely the last Activision Blizzard game to join the Game Pass lineup in 2024, but it bodes well for future additions starting in 2025, including the back catalogue of Call of Duty games.\nWith that said, the fact Crash Team Racing is still locked to 30 FPS is a bit of a bummer, as it's a game that would greatly benefit from playing at 60 FPS on Xbox Series X|S consoles. It's also more than a bit weird that it never got a Windows PC release.\nGet the Windows Central Newsletter\nAll the latest news, reviews, and guides for Windows and Xbox diehards.\nContact me with news and offers from other Future brands Receive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsors\nXbox Series X 1TB Digital Edition | $449.99 at Amazon\nThe Xbox Series X Digital Edition ditches the disc drive to give you $50 in additional savings.
