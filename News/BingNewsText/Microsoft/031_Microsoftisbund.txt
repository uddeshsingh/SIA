    "maintext": "Microsoft appears to be stepping back from charging Microsoft 365 Personal and Home subscribers another $20 per month to get access to AI-powered Office features. The software giant quietly announced it\u2019s making Copilot Pro features part of its Microsoft 365 Personal and Family subscriptions last week, but only in Australia, New Zealand, Malaysia, Singapore, Taiwan, and Thailand for now.\n\u201cIt\u2019s been nine months since we introduced consumers to Copilot in our Microsoft 365 apps via Copilot Pro. We\u2019ve spent that time adding new features, improving performance, and listening carefully to customer feedback,\u201d says Microsoft in a press release spotted by ZDNet. \u201cBased on that feedback, we\u2019re making Copilot part of our Microsoft 365 Personal and Family subscriptions.\u201d\nMicrosoft is also adding its Microsoft Designer app to Microsoft 365 Personal and Family subscriptions in these select markets. \u201cMicrosoft 365 Personal and Family subscribers will receive a monthly allotment of AI credits to use Copilot in Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Outlook, OneNote, and Designer,\u201d explains Microsoft. \u201cThe credits will also apply to apps like Paint, Photos, and Notepad on Windows.\u201d\nIf you have a Microsoft 365 Family subscription in one of these select markets, only the subscription owner will get access to Copilot and it cannot be shared with other family members.\nWhile some Microsoft 365 Personal and Family subscribers are getting more for their monthly subscription, prices are going up in exchange for Microsoft rolling in Copilot Pro.\n\u201cTo reflect the value we\u2019ve added over the past decade and enable us to deliver new innovations for years to come, we\u2019re increasing the prices of Microsoft 365 Personal and Family,\u201d says Microsoft. \u201cThe price increase will apply to existing subscribers upon their next renewal.\u201d\nThe price increases vary across Australia, New Zealand, Malaysia, Singapore, Taiwan, and Thailand. In Australia, for example, Microsoft has increased Microsoft 365 Family subscriptions by $4 AUD per month, and Personal subscriptions by $5 AUD. That\u2019s a lot less than the $33 AUD Microsoft wanted for Copilot Pro in Australia previously.\nMicrosoft has carefully selected markets here for what looks like a trial for price increases to Microsoft 365 Personal and Family that will eventually hit US and European markets. Either way, it\u2019s clear that Microsoft\u2019s Copilot Pro experiment hasn\u2019t worked out. A $20 monthly subscription on top of the Microsoft 365 Personal or Home subscription was always a big ask, and when I tried the service earlier this year I didn\u2019t think it was worth paying $20 a month for.\nI\u2019ve asked Microsoft to comment on whether these Copilot changes will appear for Microsoft 365 Home and Family subscribers in the US, and why the company has only selected these markets. Microsoft didn\u2019t respond in time for publication.\nSign up for Notepad by Tom Warren, a weekly newsletter uncovering the secrets and strategy behind Microsoft\u2019s era-defining bets on AI, gaming, and computing.
