    "maintext": "She shared that first \u201cthe economy is strong and stable. But second, meaningful uncertainties remain in the outlook. Downside risks to the labor market have increased, balanced against diminished but still real upside risks to inflation. And many of these risks are complex to assess and measure.\u201d The Dallas Fed President added that \u201cany number of shocks could influence what that path to normal will look like, how fast policy should move and where rates should settle.\u201d\nFed\u2019s Schmid followed a similar tune. He commented that any rate cuts should be carefully measured to ensure that the Fed did not misinterpret the economy\u2019s reaction. Speaking in Kansas City, the Fed President commented \u201cOutsized policy moves can provoke outsized financial market reactions to data surprises. The data are messy and subject to large revisions as we have seen in recent months. Our policy must be linked to the flow of data, but we should avoid putting too much weight on any single data point. As policymakers we should be flexible, but being nimble can come with a price. Reacting quickly builds expectations of further quick reactions.\u201d Daly shared in a webcast that the current environment \u201cis a very tight interest rate for an economy that already is on the path to 2% inflation, and I don\u2019t want to see the labor market slow further,\u201d while Kashkari stressed the data-dependent decision making at the Fed, with the central bank wanting \u201cto keep the labor market strong and we want to get inflation back down to our 2% target.\u201d\nNaturally, investors were worried that the path to 50 basis point cuts for the rest of 2024 might not be so clear. However, even though rates might be high, the US economy continues to be the star performer globally. As per the IMF, the global economy is expected to grow by 3.2% in 2024 and 2025. This is the latest estimate in October, and the fact that it\u2019s unchanged over the July estimate is solely due to the US. In its October report, the IMF revised US economic growth forecasts for 2024 and 2025 to 2.6% and 2.2%, while economies in the Middle East, Africa, and Central Asia saw downward revisions. Consequently, robust American economic growth made sure that the global estimates remained unchanged.\nOne major reason behind the bullishness surrounding America is artificial intelligence. Data from Carta shows that it\u2019s not only Wall Street that\u2019s bullish on AI. For the first three quarters of 2024, hardware and software as a service (SaaS) industries raised $7.62 billion and $18.43 billion in primary round startup investment, respectively. This marked 85% and 67% annual growth, and it signifies investors\u2019 push towards technologies that facilitate artificial intelligence.\nThe data comes on the heels of the third quarter earnings season which is also seeing a paradigm shift for the AI industry. So far, investors have been focused on one AI company, the Santa Clara, California-based AI GPU designer whose shares are up 193% year to date. Yet, now, Wall Street is also interested in Phase 2 AI companies. These companies, according to investment bank Goldman Sachs, are those that provide AI infrastructure such as servers, semiconductor companies apart from the GPU designer, and utilities that will power up the gigawatt AI data centers that Silicon Valley has in mind for its AI models.

In its latest Equity Compass note, the bank remained bullish on US stocks due to its perception of the current stock market and economic climate. \u201cFrom a single stock perspective, we think many of the large U.S. tech companies offer appealing long-term upside, especially those that have leading positions in the AI value chain,\u201d shared UBS. Shifting the focus to macroeconomics, it outlined \u201cthe combination of slowing but durable economic growth, healthy earnings growth, and continued Fed rate cuts are all supportive,\u201d adding that while \u201ceconomic growth is cooling, the labor market remains healthy. Initial claims for unemployment insurance are fairly low, there are more open jobs than unemployed people, and real wages are rising.\u201d\nThe bank also identified AI as a \u2018most attractive\u2019 thematic investing opportunity. It shares that \u201cThe shift in computing infrastructure, from central processing units to accelerated computing units (GPUs), and in applications, from retrieval-based to generative-based architectures, has far-reaching implications for AI in terms of its generalizability (the ability to make predictions based on past observations) and effectiveness.\u201d As for the potential catalysts, UBS adds that \u201cThe next catalysts we see include potential export controls imposed by the US on China in October and 3Q24 results, where we expect further positive revisions to AI infrastructure capex and more data points on AI adoption across industries.\u201d\nOur Methodology\nTo make our list of the top US stocks in the AI and growth environment, we first ranked the stock sectors in UBS\u2019 Equity Compass report by the bank\u2019s Neutral, Attractive, and Most Attractive rankings. Then, the stocks within these categories were ranked by the number of hedge funds that had bought the shares in Q2 2024.
