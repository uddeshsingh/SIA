    "maintext": "We recently published a list of Wells Fargo\u2019s Tech Stocks To Beat The S&P: 14 Top AI & Non-AI Stocks. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) stands against other Wells Fargo\u2019s tech stocks to beat the S&P.\nAs 2024 heads to a close, investors are now focused on the state of the economy, its influence on the Federal Reserve\u2019s interest rate reduction cycle, and the potential offered by the technology industry. They beckon 2025 with a rather historic run on the stock market that has seen several high-growth technology stocks flourish despite the fact that until September, interest rates in the US were at a two-decade high level.\nDriving the bullishness behind technology stocks is artificial intelligence. The revolutionary new technology that relies on high-end GPUs to run advanced mathematical techniques and infer new conclusions from existing data sets has been the focus of Wall Street and big technology companies. So far, most of the AI-related stock gains have been limited to the shares of Wall Street\u2019s favorite graphics processing unit (GPU) company whose stock is up by more than 700% since OpenAI publicly released ChatGPT.\nHowever, the gains have to broaden out to other stocks for the AI wave to continue. This broadening is dependent on the use of AI increasing among businesses and consumers. On this front, investment bank Wells Fargo has some insights to share. In its report titled \u2018Generative AI \u2014 Potential pitfalls, challenges, and risks the bank outlines that while AI \u201chas the potential to be broadly transformative,\u201d there are several \u201coutstanding questions and concerns that need to be addressed before it is widely accepted on a larger scale.\u201d Quoting its \u2018The AI Index 2024 Annual Report,\u2019 the bank points out that from 2012 to 2023, the number of AI incidents has jumped more than tenfold from sitting at roughly 10 to ~122. These incidents cover the ethical misuse of AI such as the wrong detection of criminals stemming from facial recognition systems.\nWF points out that while these incidents are concerning, other factors will also determine AI\u2019s wider acceptability and use. Broadly speaking, these factors are growing energy requirements and capital expenditure costs, global geopolitical tensions, model inaccuracies, and regulatory constraints. The bank adds that these factors are also accompanied by the potentially transformative effect of AI on the labor market. Starting from its beliefs about the labor market, WF believes that generative AI, which is different from other AI systems such as machine learning, will have a more \u201cnuanced\u201d impact on the labor market compared to traditional AI. Commenting on common worries of AI taking jobs away, the bank outlines that the jobs that AI will replace will in turn be replaced by new jobs created by AI. To quote WF, it believes \u201cgenerative AI\u2019s disruptive effect on the labor market to mirror other forms of automation \u2014 as in the past, its impact likely will be mitigated over time by new occupations spawned by the innovations themselves.\u201d\nTo help bolster its claim, WF shares data from MIT. It points out that MIT\u2019s estimates show that \u201c60% of U.S. workers are now employed in occupations that did not exist 84 years ago.\u201d As for which job functions might give way to AI, these include knowledge-based roles such as those found in financial services and support roles such as those performed by customer support agents.\nTwo additional key disruptive AI effects that Wall Street in particular is keenly aware of are its rising costs and the effect on the utility industry. The S&P\u2019s utility sector is up by 28.36% year-to-date which leads the broader index\u2019s 26.48% in gains by nearly two percentage points. Commenting on this, the bank believes that \u201cthere will be a significant increase in hardware demand, notably within the data-center environment, to accommodate the substantial increase in AI workloads,\u201d adding that \u201cit may take a number of years to increase the operational efficiency of various large language models and decrease costs to a level more in-line with existing search engines.\u201d WF also shares that while existing opportunities to expand data center footprint to accommodate AI are present, as they \u201cdiminish, companies may revisit existing data-center locations to retrofit and upgrade hardware and infrastructure in support of the power and data-consumption needs of new AI technologies.\u201d\nGiven the criticality of the data center space to AI, WF expands on this sector in another report. Titled \u2018Generative AI transforming data center landscape\u201d it comments on the capital expenditure required to set up data centers, future trends for data centers, and the stock market sectors that might benefit from growing interest and focus on the data center industry. According to its analysis, investor attention is mostly focused on AI-related investments in semiconductors and cloud computing.\nHowever, other sectors, such as \u201ccabling; steel racks; cooling (liquid and air); electrical equipment (both inside and outside the box); and backup generators\u201d are also important. WF quotes a utility company to explain why these tertiary sectors are critical in the AI wave. It shares that utility company believes that \u201cthe server rack power density required to train a generative-AI-based large language model can require up to five to seven times more power than server racks used for traditional IT workloads in a data center.\u201d\nWhile semiconductor companies are natural beneficiaries of the AI boom, some oft-ignored sectors that WF mentions are industrials and materials. It outlines that when it comes to building massive data centers, estimates suggest \u201cthat approximately 35% \u2013 45% of the cost is related to land, building shell, and basic building fit-out. These areas are addressable by companies who supply steel, aggregates, cement, and water equipment and, by extension, construction and engineering firms as well as broad non-residential construction suppliers (such as industrial distributors).\u201d Additionally, \u201c40% \u2013 45% and 15% \u2013 20% of the remaining cost can be attributed to electrical and HVAC systems respectively,\u201d according to Wells Fargo. AI is having an effect on materials, as per the bank, in the form of \u201cincreased demand for materials that are used in the production of semiconductor chips, water handling and recycling within data centers, and steel and construction materials to build data centers.\u201d\nFor some materials stocks and a primer on how they are reliant on the broader economic activity, you can check out 10 Best Materials Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Funds.\nOur Methodology\nTo make our list of Wells Fargo\u2019s top AI & non-AI stocks that can outpace the flagship S&P, we selected technology-focused stocks from the bank\u2019s recent Focus List and ranked them by their consensus next twelve-month EPS estimates.\nFor these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here).\nSalesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM)\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders In Q3 2024: 116\nNTM EPS Estimate: $10.47\nSalesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) is a software-as-a-service company that caters to the needs of the customer relationship management industry. This business model by default means that the firm has to focus on its margins, recurring revenue, and the value of its customer deals. A delivery on these fronts injects tailwinds into Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM)\u2019s share price and vice-versa. The stock has been lackluster this year as the shares have gained 28.8% year-to-date. This is on the back of investors\u2019 worries about AI disrupting the consumer service industry, as we also alluded to in the introduction to our piece. However, Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM)\u2019s shares have been doing well in the latter half of the year. They are up by 11% since the start of November on the back of catalysts such as its AI product called AI Agentforce. Consequently, future performance depends on the ability of Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) to blend AI into its business model and benefit from its sizable market share.\nPolen Capital mentioned Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) in its Q3 2024 investor letter. Here is what the fund said:\n\u201cIn the third quarter, we purchased new positions in Apple and Oracle and eliminated our small positions in Nike and Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM). We exited our position in Salesforce to fund better opportunities in Shopify and MSCI. Salesforce is seeing slower revenue growth than we would have expected, given the weakening macroeconomic environment. Furthermore, since its core end markets in customer relationship management (\u201cCRM\u201d) and Service are fairly mature, a lower growth level versus our expectations could persist for some time.\u201d\nOverall, CRM ranks 7th on our list of Wells Fargo\u2019s tech stocks to beat the S&P: 14 top AI & non-AI stocks. CRM is a top cyclical stock Wells Fargo is confident about. While we acknowledge the potential of CRM as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame.
