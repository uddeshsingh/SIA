Photographer: David Paul Morris/Bloomberg via Getty Images\nBenioff has been publicly differentiating Agentforce from competing offerings on the market, such as Microsoft's Copilot.\nIn late October, Benioff wrote in a post X that \"Copilot's a flop because Microsoft lacks the data, metadata, and enterprise security models to create real corporate intelligence\" while Agentforce \"is transforming businesses now... This is what AI was meant to be.\"\nEarlier that month, Benioff said in an episode of the Masters of Scale Rapid Response podcast that Copilot is \"disappointing\" and \"I don't think Copilot will be around, I don't think customers will use it.\"\nRelated: 'A Flop': Salesforce's CEO Keeps Comparing Microsoft AI to Clippy, Calls It 'Inaccurate'\nMeanwhile, Salesforce touts Agentforce's results. In a September announcement of the technology, Salesforce stated that one of its clients, Wiley, had seen a 40% increase in cases resolved after using a customer service AI agent.",
