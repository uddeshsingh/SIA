    "maintext": "Stocks posted solid gains as Wall Street put the finishing touches on one of its best months of the year.\nThe Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 rose 0.6% while the Dow Jones industrial average gained 0.4%. Both indexes closed out November with their best monthly performances of the year. The Nasdaq added 0.8%. Friday was an abbreviated trading day, with stocks closing at 1 p.m. Eastern time and the bond market an hour later.\nInvestors were looking to see how much shoppers are willing to spend on gifts for the holidays. Black Friday unofficially kicked off the holiday shopping season, although retailers had been offering early deals for weeks. Macy\u2019s and Best Buy each gained about 2%.\nApple rose 1.1%. The technology giant is hoping recently added artificial intelligence features are enough to entice consumers to treat themselves or their loved ones to a new iPhone for the holidays.\nThe Dow rose 7.5% in November, easily its best month of 2024. Walt Disney Co. has the biggest percentage gain for the month at 22.1%, but the price-weighted index also got a boost from Goldman Sachs, up 17.5% to $608.57, and Salesforce, up more than 13% to $329.99.\nThe S&P 500 gained 5.7% this month, driven by Tesla and other stocks that received a boost from Donald Trump\u2019s win in the presidential election. Discover Financial Services leads a list of financial stocks that had a good November, up nearly 23% for the month despite a small loss Friday. Investors believe the credit card company\u2019s merger with Capital One has a greater chance of going through under a Trump administration and overall the financial services industry faces less restrictive oversight.\nTesla shares rose 3.7% on Friday and posted a monthly increase of more than 38%. The electric vehicle maker is expected to benefit from Chief Executive Elon Musk\u2019s support of Trump.\nMusk also gave a boost to Hasbro shares after he triggered takeover speculation when he asked in a post on X how much the toy and game company was worth. Hasbro, which owns the role-playing game Dungeons & Dragons, rose 2%.\nBond yields fell, with the yield on the 10-year Treasury slipping to 4.19%.\nBitcoin, which recently made a run at $100,000 before dropping back, briefly rose back above $98,000 but was recently trading around $97,300.\nGlobal markets mostly fell. Tokyo\u2019s Nikkei 225 index fell 0.4% after the government reported that inflation in Tokyo, considered an indicator for national trends, was 2.6% in November, up from 1.8% last month mainly due to a surge in fresh food prices.\nChinese markets advanced. Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng index gained 0.3%. Meanwhile, the Shanghai composite index rose 0.9%. Retailers\u2019 stocks drove market gains after a two-day meeting in Beijing that focused on promoting consumption ended on Thursday.",
