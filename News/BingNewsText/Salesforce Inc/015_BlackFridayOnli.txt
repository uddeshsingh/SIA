    "maintext": "Online retail continued to be the big winner of the holiday season on Black Friday, with record levels of e-commerce spending. In-person shopping, however, was down 8%, according to one measurement, on the day that traditionally draws the biggest crowds to stores and malls.\nBoth Adobe Analytics and Salesforce, which track online sales, showed big jumps in e-commerce spending on Black Friday.\nForbesAmazon Black Friday Ad Costs Rise As Brands Battle For Holiday Shoppers\nAdobe Analytics reported $10.8 billion in U.S. online sales on Black Friday, up 10.2% over last year. That is the record amount of Black Friday spending clocked by Adobe Analytics since it began tracking online sales.\n\u201cCrossing the $10 billion mark is a big e-commerce milestone for Black Friday, for a day that in the past was anchored towards in-store shopping,\u201d said Vivek Pandya, lead analyst, Adobe Digital Insights, in a statement with the Black Friday data.\nSome of that increase may have come at the expense of in-person store visits.\nForbesShoppers Spent Over $6 Billion Online On Thanksgiving, As Cyber Week Begins\nBlack Friday Store Visits Down 8%\nSensormatic Solutions, which has been tracking in-store crowds on Black Friday for decades, saw an 8.2% drop in traffic this year, reversing the trend of increased traffic following the worst year of the pandemic.\nTraffic for the week of Thanksgiving, from November 24 to 29, was down 3.9%, and traffic for the full year, to date, is down 3%.\nSensormatic Solutions tracks visitors to retail stores, and the numbers don\u2019t include mall visitors who go to the movies or restaurants but don\u2019t enter stores.\nGrant Gustafson, head of retail and analytics at Sensormatic Solutions, said the earlier Black Friday promotions this year appears to have contributed to the weaker turnout on Black Friday.\n\u201cSome of the weeklong Black Friday extended promotions have really led to a little bit of a softer day of traffic than anticipated,\u201d Gustafson said.\nRetailNext, which draws traffic data from U.S. stores that operate on its platform, reported that nationwide U.S. store traffic was down 3.2% compared to 2023, with Midwest storms and deep freeze causing a sharp 7% drop in traffic in that region.\nThis year\u2019s Black Friday numbers demonstrate the the shift to online shopping is continuing to grow.\n\u201cAnd with consumers getting more comfortable with everything from mobile shopping to chat bots, we have tailwinds that can prop up online growth for Black Friday moving forward,\u201d Adobe analyst Pandya said.\n$11 Million Spent Online Every Minute\nOn Black Friday, between the hours of 10 a.m. and 2 p.m. across time zones, Americans were spending $11.3 million online every minute, according to Adobe.\nAdobe Analytics draws its data by analyzing online transactions covering over 1 trillion vists to U.S. retail sites and includes 18 product categories.\nSalesforce, which draws its data from 1.5 billion global consumers in its Commerce Cloud, Marketing Cloud and Service Cloud platforms, reported that consumers spent $74.4 billion worldwide on Black Friday and $17.5 billion in the United States. U.S. online sales were up 7% over last year, according to Salesforce.\nMore than half of the online purchases on Black Friday were made on mobile devices, according to Adobe Analytics and Salesforce, and AI-powered chatbots played a big role in influencing purchases.\nTraffic to retail sites from chatbot interactions increased by 1,800% year-over-year on Black Friday, Adobe Analytics reported.\nDigital Brands See Black Friday Growth\nShopify, the platform used by millions of online merchants and brands, reported today that it rang up global sales of $5 billion on Black Friday, with sales of $4.6 million per minute during the peak period.\nBrunt Workwear, a work boots and clothing brand that uses Shopify for its e-commerce sales, did $2.5 million in online sales on Black Friday, up 85% for the day.\n\u201cOn Black Friday specifically we had an order every six seconds through Shopify,\u201d Eric Girouard, founder and CEO of Brunt, said in an interview. Girouard launched Brunt four years ago and expects to do over $9 million in sales over the Thanksgiving through Cyber Monday period.\nAnother Shopify online brand, BK Beauty, also saw strong sales growth on Black Friday and during the weeks leading up to Thanksgiving. Co-founder Paul Jauregui said in an interview that Black Friday sales were up 35%, and sales during the two weeks leading up to Black Friday were up 90%, year-over-year, driven in part by a very successful live shopping event on TikTok.\nJauregui said BK Beauty is looking at Black Friday/Cyber Monday as a three-week period, rather than a five-day event. \u201cWe pulled Black Friday forward,\u201d he said. That plan has worked out, he said, \u201cThis month is our biggest month in company history,\u201d he said.\nThe spreading out of holiday shopping, into a months long rather than weeks, or days long activity has reduced the crowds at stores and malls on Black Friday, but Sensormatic Solutions still is expecting a number of very busy shopping days in the weeks leading up to Christmas.\nAnd while overall national in-store traffic was down on Black Friday, a number of malls reported bigger than expected crowds.\nWestfield Garden State Plaza in Paramus, N.J., one of the New York metro area\u2019s biggest and more productive malls, saw the types of crowds and car traffic that it hasn\u2019t seen since Black Friday, 2018, Senior General Manager Wesley Rebisz said in an interview.\n\u201cGen Z really showed up to shop,\u201d Rebisz said. \u201cThey turned out very strongly in the morning and stayed the whole day,\u201d he said.",
