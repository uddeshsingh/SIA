    "maintext": "U.S. consumers spent a record amount online on Thanksgiving Day, as the busiest days of the holiday shopping season got off to a strong start.\nAs shoppers head to the stores today for Black Friday deals, online results are showing that consumers are responding strongly to Cyber Week deals that kicked off this week.\nOnline sales tracked by Adobe Analytics, Salesforce, and Shopify showed online growth on Thanksgiving.\nSalesforce is projecting that based on Thanksgiving Day results this could be the strongest Cyber Week ever in terms of online sales.\nForbesAmazon Black Friday Ad Costs Rise As Brands Battle For Holiday Shoppers\nWhile the numbers available thus far reflect online sales only, there are early indications that Americans are showing up to shop in stores as well.\nPass-by, an AI-powered geospatial insights company that tracks store visits, showed on its live Black Friday counter on its website that over 143 million shoppers had visited U.S. retailers by 11:30 a.m. today. That is down slightly compared to last year, but could reflect the fact that online shopping means it no longer is necessary to get to stores early for doorbuster deals.\nForbesBlack Friday Online Sales Up 10%, As In-Store Traffic Falls 8%\nAdobe Analytics, which has been tracking online prices since 2014, reported that U.S shoppers spent a record 6.1 billion online on Thanksgiving, up 8.8% over the previous Thanksgiving. That\u2019s a significantly stronger growth rate than Thanksgiving Day 2023, when online sales rose 5.5%. according to Adobe.\nMuch of the increased online shopping on Thanksgiving apparently was driven by the ease of mobile shopping, which allows consumers to make quick purchases on their phones while in the midst of other activities.\nMobile purchases were up 10.5% on Thanksgiving, and accounted for more than half of all purchases, at 59.5%, adding up to $3.6 billion spent, Adobe reported.\nThe peak period for mobile purchases on Thanksgiving Day was between 8 and 10 p.m. across time zones, according to Adobe.\nPurchases made using buy now, pay later plans were up 10.3%, at $430 million, Adobe reported.\nSalesforce, which tracks global online sales across its Commerce Cloud, Marketing Cloud, and Service Cloud platforms, reported global Thanksgiving Day sales of $33.6 billion, up 6%.\nU.S. online sales on Thanksgiving were up 8%, at $8.1 billion, Salesforce reported.\nThe early data shows that consumers were waiting for Cyber Week deals, and were ready to spend when they arrived.\n\u201cBack in the spring of 2024, nearly two thirds of consumers reported that they were waiting for Cyber Week deals to make splurge purchases,\u201d Caila Schwartz, Director of Consumer Insights at Salesforce, said in response to the Thanksgiving numbers.\n\u201cThe sales and order growth over the last few days implies that these shoppers stayed true to their word,\u201d Schwartz said. \u201cThis could be the strongest Cyber Week we\u2019ve ever seen.\u201d\nShopify, the e-commerce platform used by millions of merchants and brands, also reported a strong start to the peak selling period.\nThe peak sales hour on Thanksgiving for Shopify merchants was 9 p.m. EST, and the average cart price was $164.47, Shopify reported.\nShopify President Harley Finkelstein, in an emailed comment this morning, said the outlook is good for a strong weekend for Shopify merchants.\n\u201cWe\u2019re just a few hours into Black Friday in North America, but the excitement is already building across the globe, with merchants gearing up for a strong weekend,\u201d Finkelstein said.\n\u201cOne thing is clear,\u201d Finkelstein said, \u201cconsumers are continuing to buy from their favorite brands, and those brands are all powered by Shopify, It\u2019s shaping up to be another incredible Black Friday weekend for entrepreneurs,\u201d he said.",
