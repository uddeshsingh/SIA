    "maintext": "Sabrina Carpenter hosting a holiday variety music special on Netflix and Keira Knightley and Ben Whishaw playing a spy and an assassin in the TV series \u201cBlack Doves\" are some of the new television, films, music and games headed to a device near you.\nAlso among the streaming offerings worth your time as selected by The Associated Press\u2019 entertainment journalists: K-pop star Ros\u00e9 has her first solo full-length album, Tim Burton\u2019s \u201cBeetlejuice Beetlejuice\u201d enjoys another afterlife odyssey and BLACKPINK\u2019s Ros\u00e9 has her first solo full-length album.\n\u2014 Thirty-six years after the original, the Deetz family returns to Winter River in Tim Burton\u2019s \u201cBeetlejuice Beetlejuice \u201d (streaming Saturday, Dec. 7 on Max). There, Lydia (Winona Ryder), still haunted by Beetlejuice (Michael Keaton), is forced into another afterlife odyssey when her teenage daughter (Jenna Ortega) discovers a portal. In her review, AP\u2019s Jocelyn Noveck called it \u201ca joyously rendered sequel that sometimes makes sense, and sometimes doesn\u2019t, but just keeps rollicking.\u201d\n\u2014 A lowkey reunion of \u201cLove Actually\u201d writer-director Richard Curtis and one of that film\u2019s stars, Bill Nighy, is part of the new Netflix animated movie \u201cThat Christmas\u201d (streaming Wednesday). The film was co-written by Curtis (it\u2019s based on his series of Christmas books) and features Nighy as the voice of Lighthouse Bill, one of the Wellington-on-Sea townspeople grappling with a winter blizzard. The storm poses challenges even for Santa, voiced by Brian Cox.\n\u2014 Scarlett Johansson and Channing Tatum star in the space race rom-com \u201cFly Me to the Moon,\u201d about a NASA launch director (Tatum) and a Madison Avenue marketing executive tasked with selling the mission to the moon. The film, which debuted in theaters in July, hits Apple TV+ on Wednesday. In her review, AP Film Writer Lindsey Bahr praised it as \u201clighthearted and breezy with a pleasing screwball energy, giving Johansson the opportunity to use the full wattage of her movie star power.\u201d\n\u2014 AP Film Writer Jake Coyle\n\u2014 Does espresso go with eggnog? Find out when Sabrina Carpenter hosts a holiday variety music special that streams on Netflix starting Friday, Dec. 6. \u201cIt\u2019s an hour of literal nonsense,\u201d Sabrina told Time magazine about the special. \u201cIf people are expecting boring, me singing by a tree, it\u2019s not that. It\u2019s so fun, so chaotic. There are so many guests that I\u2019m excited about.\u201d Those guests include Chappell Roan, Tyla, Shania Twain, Kali Uchis, Quinta Brunson, Cara Delevingne, Kyle Mooney, Nico Hiraga, Megan Stalter, Sean Astin, Owen Thiele and Jillian Bell.\n\u2014 Lauren Mayberry, vocalist and percussionist from the Scottish pop band Chvrches, makes her solo debut with \u201cVicious Creature.\u201d The 12 tracks veer from the coffee-house folk of \u201cAnywhere But Dancing\u201d to the punky \u201cPunch Drunk,\u201d the dance-pop of \u201cChange Shapes\u201d and stuttering glam of \u201cSorry, Etc.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s a mission statement of all things that you like,\u201d she tells us in an interview.\n\u2014 Mayberry isn\u2019t the only woman setting out alone \u2014 BLACKPINK\u2019s Ros\u00e9 has her first solo full-length album, titled \u201crosie,\u201d scheduled for release on Friday, Dec. 6. She kicked it off with \u201cAPT.,\u201d her collaborative with pop star Bruno Mars. The catchy pop-punk track, inspired by a popular Korean drinking game, known as the \u201capartment game.\u201d It has spent weeks atop the Billboard Global 200 chart. On Instagram, she previewed the album by saying \u201cI have poured my blood and tears into this album. I cannot wait for you to listen to this little journal of mine.\u201d\n\u2014 AP Entertainment Writer Mark Kennedy\n\u2014 In their new Netflix series \u201cBlack Doves,\u201d Keira Knightley and Ben Whishaw play old friends who also happen to be a spy and an assassin, that team up to solve a murder (and get revenge) at Christmas. Knightley joked to The Associated Press that the show falls in the \u201cDie Hard\u201d category of holiday entertainment. \u201cIt\u2019s like, I\u2019ve spent too much time with my family. I hate them all. I need to watch something blow up!\u201d \u201cBlack Doves\u201d debuts Thursday on the streamer.\n\u2014 Margo Martindale stars in the new Prime Video series \u201cThe Sticky,\u201d as a down-on-her-luck woman on the brink of financial ruin who finds herself in a crime ring stealing, of all things, millions of dollars\u2019 worth of maple syrup. It\u2019s inspired by a true story. The dark comedy also stars a delightful Chris Diamantopoulos and Guillaume Cyr. Jamie Lee Curtis is an executive producer and also makes an appearance. It premieres Friday, Dec. 6.\n\u2014 Alicia Rancilio\n\u2014 Multiplayer free-for-alls like Overwatch and Apex Legends remain popular online, but it\u2019s been years since a new release has made an impact. Chinese-owned NetEase Games is hoping to shake up the genre by adding superheroes and villains to the formula with Marvel Rivals. The core competition is a battle between two teams of six heroes each. The initial lineup includes marquee names like Spider-Man, Black Panther and Captain America as well as a few cult favorites like Luna Snow and Jeff the Land Shark. Some characters \u2014 say Thor, Loki and Hela \u2014 can join forces to unleash all sorts of havoc. It\u2019s all free-to-play, and the mayhem begins Friday, Dec. 6, on PlayStation 5, Xbox X/S and PC.",
