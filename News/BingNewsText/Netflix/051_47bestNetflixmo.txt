He enters the battlefield with a mind filled with propaganda but soon realizes his dreams of being an iconic hero reached too far.

While Baumbach has fared well in fractured family tales before, this film stands out for deftly telling both sides of the chaotic divorce at its core. Of course, that would mean little without strong acting, and the leading performances of Scarlett Johansson and Adam Driver make the emotional trauma real for all watching.

One of the best movies on Netflix is long enough to be broken into 4 digestible 'episodes' that are about 52 minutes each. And this crime thriller utilizes each and every moment to build suspenseful situations for Robert De Niro, Joe Pesci and Al Pacino, with the latter portraying Jimmy Hoffa, a good friend of De Niro's character.\nGenre: Crime drama\nRotten Tomatoes score: 97%\nStars: Robert De Niro, Joe Pesci, Al Pacino\nDirector: Martin Scorsese\nWatch now\nEl Camino: A Breaking Bad Movie (2019)\nBreaking Bad fans have had it good.

Last we saw Jesse, he was driving off after being held captive. But breaking free is just the first step in a fraught journey for Jesse, who has to figure out how to leave his life behind and start over. Does this movie need to exist? No, but it's deeply satisfying to hang out with Jesse again and to see so many Breaking Bad cameos.\nGenre: Crime/Drama\nRotten Tomatoes score: 91%\nStars: Aaron Paul, Jesse Plemons, Bryan Cranston\nDirector: Vince Gilligan\nWatch now\nThe Power of the Dog (2021)\nAn adaptation of Thomas Savage's novel of the same name, The Power of The Dog is another film that Netflix can use to say \"we're not all Adam Sandler comedies and big action movies.\" An intense western set in 1925 Montana, the film is focused on two ranch-owning brothers: Phil (Benedict Cumberbatch) and George (Jesse Plemons). George marries Rose (Kirsten Dunst) who has sent her son Peter (Kodi Smith-McPhee) to college to study medicine.\nUnfortunately, Phil's the mean-spirited and cruel type, and he loves to be meant to Rose and Peter. Stellar performances from the whole cast are heightened by the film's gorgeous beauty and a phenomenal score from Johny Greenwood (whose also composed for The Phantom Thread, among others). It's one of Netflix's latest Oscar-nominated movies.\nGenre: Western/Drama\nRotten Tomatoes score: 96%\nStars: Benedict Cumberbatch, Kirsten Dunst, Jesse Plemons, Kodi Smit-McPhee\nDirector: Jane Campion\nWatch now\nRoma (2018)\nThis beautifully-shot black-and-white film gives director Alfonso Cuar\u00f3n a chance to show a slice of his past. Taking place in Mexico City in the early 1970s, Roma focuses on an indigenous woman who serves a white family, as they all fight to survive calamity after calamity. From betrayals to natural disasters, Roma throws the kitchen sink at this family, and then tacks on the Corpus Christi Massacre of 1971. Emotionally harrowing, this Academy Award-nominated film (and one of the best dramas on Netflix) demands you watch with tissues or some other coping mechanism.\nGenre: Drama\nRotten Tomatoes score: 96%\nStars: Yalitza Aparicio, Marina de Tavira\nDirector: Alfonso Cuaron\nWatch now\nMudbound (2017)\nBlack soldiers have fought alongside white soldiers for America in many wars, but come home only to find they have to fight for their lives in a different way. That's the message of Dee Rees' powerful drama, set after World War II. White soldier Jamie McAllen (Garrett Hedlund) and black soldier Ronsel Jackson (Jason Mitchell) return to their small Mississippi town. Jamie's brother owns a struggling farm, where Ronsel's parents work as tenants. The two former soldiers begin to build a friendship, but the racist attitudes of Jamie's family and the community lead to a devastating confrontation.\nGenre: Historical drama\nRotten Tomatoes score: 97%\nStars: Carey Mulligan, Jason Clarke, Mary J. Blige\nDirector: Dee Rees\nWatch now\nThe Ballad of Buster Scruggs (2018)\nThe Coen Brothers do it again, with a sumptuous short story slab of Western storytelling. Starring a whole host of A-list actors, and James Franco, the anthology has been nominated for three Academy awards and is a movie that wriggles through both comedy and blood-speckled violence seamlessly. Yes, it\u2019s a satire on Westerns, and yes there\u2019s plenty of Coen-esque characters involved, but beneath the pastiche this is a love letter that tips a cowboy hat to the movies of old.\u2014 Marc Chacksfield\nGenre: Western drama\nRotten Tomatoes score: 91%\nStars: Tim Blake Nelson, James Franco, Liam Neeson, Zoe Kazan\nDirector: Ethan Coen, Joel Coen\nWatch now\nTigertail (2020)\nA delicate, elegant love story that spans continents and decades, Tigertail comes from writer/director Alan Yang, an Emmy winner and co-creator of Master of None.

While vacationing at an idyllic home in the middle of nowhere, a cyberattack destroys society as we know it. A cautionary tale of overreliance on technology and a terrifying vision of a different kind of apocalypse, this Netflix original is a big budget picture of what our future could look like should social order crumble in many of the same ways around us.\nGenre: Apocalyptic psychological thriller\nRotten Tomatoes score: 74%\nStars: Julia Roberts, Ethan Hawke, Mahershala Ali, Kevin Bacon\nDirector: Sam Esmail\nWatch now\nThey Cloned Tyrone (2023)\nFontaine (John Boyega) sells drugs, Slick Charles (Jamie Foxx) is a pimp and Yo-Yo (Teyonah Parris) is a sex worker. And while this trio may come off as caricaturish in a bad way if you only read that above sentence and watched They Cloned Tyrone's trailer expecting the worst, Netflix's managed to release a gem of a movie.\nAnd it all starts with a big twist that you might have ruined for you (as it was for me) when you read a review. Instead, just take my word that Netflix's created a stellar modern Blaxploitation movie that deals with government surveillance. And its trio of leads all deliver to make it a must-see.\nGenre: Sci-fi comedy thriller\nRotten Tomatoes score: 91%\nStars: John Boyega, Jamie Foxx, Teyonah Parris, Kiefer Sutherland, David Alan Grier\nDirectors: Juel Taylor\nWatch now\nMissing (2023)\nJune (Storm Reid) was going to have the weekend most teen dream of.

In fact, I think you should see this film on Netflix, rather than spend time and money to see Benoit Blanc's latest mystery in theaters. This sequel finds the southern sleuth on a private island in Greece where a wealthy tech mogul is pretending to get killed to set up a murder mystery for his friends, a group of influencers who call themselves disruptors.

But while Murphy owns the film outright, we get another actor coming out from the shadows to wow us, with Wesley Snipes stealing scenes as D'Urville Martin, the director who Moore clashes with. But while the film is stocked to the brim with great actors (including Keegan-Michael Key, Craig Robinson and Tituss Burgess), this is still Murphy's film. This is one of the best movies on Netflix overall.\nGenre: Dramatic comedy\nRotten Tomatoes score: 97%\nStars: Eddie Murphy, Wesley Snipes, Da'Vine Joy Randolph\nDirector: Craig Brewer\nWatch now\nIf you want to browse more of our favorite funny films and shows, we've listed even more of the best comedies on Netflix to keep the laughs coming.\nAction\nTroll (2022)\nProfessor Nora Tidemann (Ine Marie Wilmann) is a paleontologist with trolls etched in her memory from childhood.

Rajamouli described his amazing epic film RRR, which focuses on two Indian folk heroes working together to fight British Colonialists in the 1920's. It all starts when an evil colonialist steals a girl after tricking her family into a \"sale\" they didn't know was happening. RRR, which feels part Fast & Furious and part Step Brothers, is a joyous epic film that we bet the MCU will be copying in upcoming Marvel movies for years to come.\nGenre: Drama/Action\nRotten Tomatoes score: 89%\nStars: N.T.

Since this is a Black Mirror film, though, everything goes crazy as the audience is given the ability to direct the protagonist's actions, turning the movie into a choose-your-own-adventure experience. The many forking twists of the film mean that its advertised 90 minute run time can stretch to 150 minutes, if you find all of its endings and story points.\nGenre: Interactive sci-fi drama\nRotten Tomatoes score: 72%\nStars: Fionn Whitehead, Will Poulter, Craig Parkinson\nDirector: David Slade\nWatch now\nFor more of our favorite sci-fi movies, we've listed even more of the best sci-fi movies on Netflix so you can delve into wilder adventures.\nDocumentaries\nVictim/Suspect (2023)\nWhile much of Netflix's documentaries look back at famous true crime stories of note, Victim/Suspect takes on a more important topic.

Currently, they live in a region known as Africatown (found near Mobile, Alabama), and this film shows their fight to keep their communal story from being forgotten.
