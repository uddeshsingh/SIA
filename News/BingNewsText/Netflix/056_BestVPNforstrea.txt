    "maintext": "VPNs aren\u2019t just useful for keeping your online activities safe and private, they\u2019re also a great way to bypass restrictions on streaming content in other countries. The top VPN providers continue to stay one step ahead of streaming services in a never-ending cat-and-mouse game, ensuring that you always have access to your favorite content no matter where you are. I\u2019ve thoroughly tested the top VPNs on the market to see how they fare at unblocking the top streaming sites and curated the best in the list below.\nWhy you should trust me: Here at PCWorld we\u2019ve been testing computer hardware, software, and services since the 1980s. For my part, I\u2019m continually testing all of the major VPNs on the market and many lesser-known services in order to curate a list of the very best VPNs across a variety of categories. Below you\u2019ll find my favorite VPNs, and below those, helpful advice about what to look for when choosing a VPN on your own.\n[ ]\nIf you\u2019re looking to use your VPN for more than streaming, be sure to check out our comprehensive roundup of the best VPNs in all categories, as well.\nOther VPN reviews and features\nTunnelBear VPN: This charming VPN is very user-friendly and it can access most U.S. streaming services, but inconsistent speeds hold it back from making this list.\nPrivadoVPN: A Swiss-based VPN that comes with decent speeds, good streaming service compatibility, and an excellent free version.\nNorton Secure VPN: The trusted security giant offers a simple, but underdeveloped VPN.\nHere\u2019s why you need a VPN with in-flight Wi-Fi\nHow to test your VPN speed\nVPNs and the law: How often does law enforcement actually request VPN logs?\nWhy does Netflix block VPNs?\nNetflix\u2019s big expansion into pretty much every country on earth back in 2016 meant it had to get tough on VPNs. While Netflix produces a lot of its own content that it can make available worldwide, the company also licenses a ton of content from traditional entertainment studios.\nThese third parties are still working on a system of global territory licensing. Under this system, Netflix gets a package of movies and TV shows from these companies that it can show in the U.S., but that aren\u2019t licensed to be shown by Netflix in, say, Europe. To keep those companies and their other international licensees happy, Netflix must enforce a block on VPNs to prevent people from getting content made available to Netflix subscribers in the UK, but not the U.S.\n\u201cWe are making progress in licensing content across the world,\u201d Netflix said in a 2016 blog post. \u201cBut we have a ways to go before we can offer people the same films and TV series everywhere.\u201d\nNetflix isn\u2019t the only company that has to enforce these restrictions. Amazon Prime Video, Hulu, and others do it too. However, Netflix along with Hulu are easily the most active and effective at it.\nWhat to look for in a VPN to access Netflix streaming\nFirst, most people should not make speed the top consideration. The minimum recommended bandwidth for a 1080p Netflix stream is 5 megabits per second (Mbps). If you\u2019re streaming in 4K it\u2019s 15Mbps. Depending on your home internet speed, that should be doable with nearly all the top VPNs.\nInstead, the first consideration should be the basic promise of Netflix compatibility from a reputable company. That\u2019s the rub. Any old VPN can promise Netflix compatibility, but if there aren\u2019t a lot of reviews about the service it may not be the real deal. Stick to well-known VPN services if you can.\nNext, you need to consider how many servers are available for the service \u2014 especially the number in your target country. If you want Netflix Australia and the VPN only has two Australian servers, that could be a problem. Most of the popular VPN services list their server networks online so you can see how many servers are in each country.\nFinally, make sure the VPN\u2019s desktop app (and don\u2019t forget about mobile) allows you to choose specific servers. Since this is a cat-and-mouse game with the streamers, you need a VPN with a number of servers in your desired Netflix country. That way if one server has been discovered by Netflix, it\u2019s possible the others are still working. The fix for this then is easy \u2014 just switch servers.\nHow I tested\nI judge VPNs on a variety of criteria including server network, connection speeds, privacy protections, ease-of-use, additional features, and cost. For a more detailed guide on how I test, check out PCWorld\u2019s comprehensive guide on how we test VPN services.\nSpeed tests are kept as simple as possible. I average the connections between different global locations for any given VPN and then compare them to a baseline internet speed to get a good picture of the overall connection speeds. I thoroughly research and analyze the privacy policies and histories of each VPN and note any outstanding discrepancies or data collection issues.\nIn regards to unblocking capabilities, I connect to multiple servers around the world with each VPN and try to access content on all major streaming services such as Netflix, Amazon Prime, HBO Max, Hulu, Disney Plus, and more.",
