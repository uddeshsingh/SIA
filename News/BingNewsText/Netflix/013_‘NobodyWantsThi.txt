    "maintext": "It\u2019s been two months since Nobody Wants This hit Netflix and enchanted the world with an unexpected relationship between a Jewish rabbi (Adam Brody) and a sex podcast host (Kristen Bell). And now, we want more.\nThe show, which is loosely based on creator Erin Foster\u2019s own love story, quickly became a smash hit for the streaming platform and was immediately lauded as one of the funniest (and sexiest) new shows of 2024. How funny and sexy is this show? Fans have created thousands of TikTok edits, written full-blown dissertations on the relationship dynamics at play, and even sold out the outfits worn by the characters in the show. It\u2019s legit.\nSo here we are, wondering if and when we will get another fix of Joanne (Bell) and Noah\u2019s (Brody) unconventional courtship. And don\u2019t get us wrong, we love the incredible chemistry between the two main players, but we\u2019re also missing the eccentric cast of characters that make up the killer ensemble, including Joanne\u2019s sister Morgan (Justine Lupe), Noah\u2019s brother Sasha (Timothy Simons), and Noah\u2019s sister-in-law Esther (Jackie Tohn). We can only venture to guess how these rambunctious players will shake things up \u2014 we\u2019re looking at you Morgan and Sasha \u2014 in the new season. Will their flirtship (a cross between a flirtation and a friendship) take a turn and how will Esther approach Sasha after finding out about his contact with Morgan?\nWe didn\u2019t even get into the fact that Season 1 left much to the imagination on where Joanne and Noah are headed after a moment of uncertainty and a brief breakup. We have so many questions about how the story will move forward!\nLuckily, we are committed to answering the rhetorical questions we ask here at Decider. The bad news is that we will have to wait a bit on the plot details of Season 2, but we can answer questions like if there will be a second season and when it can be expected. Keep reading to find out everything we know about the deliciously scandalous rom-com.\nIs Nobody Wants This Coming Back For a Season 2?\nYes! Nobody Wants This was renewed for a second season in early October after premiering at the end of September. It took just two weeks for Netflix to give the show the green light!\nAccording to Netflix data, some 15.9 million viewers watched the show in its first full week of streaming on the platform. In fact, it became the No. 1 English-language show on Netflix for a stretch in October, even beating out Monsters: The Lyle and Erik Menendez Story.\nWhen Will Nobody Wants This Season 2 Release on Netflix?\nSadly, no date for Nobody Wants This Season 2 has been confirmed. But fear not, there is a hopeful and exciting update on the show\u2019s progress, straight from one of the stars. In November, Brody spoke with Variety and shared that filming for Season 2 begins in February.\n\u201cWe\u2019re shooting in February and hopefully they\u2019ll have it out by September next year,\u201d The O.C. alum told the outlet. Fingers crossed things go according to plan!\nAround the same time, Foster posted a group pic of the creatives for Season 2 all wearing matching sweatshirts in the writers\u2019 room, joking that their \u201ccreative juices\u201d are flowing.\nHas Netflix Added Anyone To the Cast or Crew for Season 2?\nNo big updates on the cast (is it too early to wish for a reunion with some of Bell\u2019s The Good Place co-stars or Brody\u2019s O.C. cast mates?) but we do know about some new faces on the producing side of the camera.\nFor Season 2, Foster and Netflix have brought in Jenni Konner and Bruce Eric Kaplan, two of the creative minds behind HBO\u2019s Girls. The pair will act as co-showrunners while Single Drunk Female alum Nora Silver joins as an executive producer.\n\u201cI\u2019m so lucky to be able to continue this story,\u201d Foster told Tudum, \u201cand to do it alongside Jenni Konner and Bruce Eric Kaplan, who I\u2019ve been such a fan of since Girls. \u2026 Justice for healthy relationships being the most romantic!\u201d\n\u201cI am excited beyond belief to be a part of Season 2 of Nobody Wants This, created by the hilarious Erin Foster,\u201d Kaplan added. \u201cIt is such a unique and beautiful show, and I am already having the best time working on it.\u201d\nHow Can I Watch Nobody Wants This?\nYou can watch the full first season of Nobody Wants This on Netflix right now. There are 10 episodes available so maybe try to parcel them out between now and roughly next fall.",
