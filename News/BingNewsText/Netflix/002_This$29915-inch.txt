    "maintext": "If you\u2019re looking for a basic laptop that won\u2019t be some sad sack potato for performance, look no further than the HP Laptop 15t-fd000 for Cyber Monday.\nNormally, this laptop costs a modest $820, but HP has a 12-hour \u201cflash sale,\u201d knocking the HP Laptop 15 price to just $299, or 63% off. While supplies last, of course.\n\ud83d\udd25The hottest Cyber Monday deals\ud83d\udd25\n\ud83d\udcbbHP EliteBook 14 (Ryzen 7 PRO) | $589 at HP (Save $2,333!)\n\ud83c\udfaeASUS ROG Ally (Z1) | $349.99 at Best Buy (Save $150!)\n\ud83d\udda5\ufe0fGeekom AR12 Lite Mini PC (Intel N100) | $169 at Amazon (Save $30!)\n\ud83d\udd79\ufe0fXbox Game Pass Ultimate (3-months) | $27.99 at CDKeys (Save $12!)\n\ud83c\udfaeLenovo Legion Go (Z1 Extreme) | $484.99 at Amazon (Save $215!)\n\ud83d\udcbbSurface Pro 11 w/ keyboard (X Plus) | $899.99 at Best Buy (Save $450!)\nIs the HP Laptop 15 any good?\nYou might wonder what you're getting for $299.\nThe good news is that this laptop does not use an Intel Duo or \u201cbudget\u201d processor but a full-fledged Core i5-1335U (up to 4.6 GHz) with 10 cores. Yeah, that\u2019s just a normal Core i5 processor for Ultrabooks\u2014no Centrino here!\nYou also get 8GB of zippy DDR4-3200 RAM (1x 8GB), so you can always add more later. For storage, you get a 256GB SSD, which is plenty fast (and, like RAM, is user-upgradeable).\nEven the 15.6\u201d display is OK at HD (1366x768), anti-glare, and 250 nits of brightness. It is no HDR OLED display, and it\u2019ll struggle outdoors, but if you\u2019re talking in your home office or on the couch, you\u2019ll be just fine.\nPorts are also basic but welcomed with 1 Type-C (but only for data, not charging), two Type-A legacy ports, a barrel charger port (with Fast Charge), HDMI 1.4b, and your headphone jack.\nWhat's neat is IF you have a bit more budget you can actually customize this laptop at HP.com and improve RAM (up to 16GB), storage (up to 1TB), CPU (up to a Core i7 P-processor), and even the display (up to Full HD) to something you may prefer.\nFinally, at least on HP.com, it has 4.4 out of 5 stars out of 520 reviews, which is pretty solid. The biggest complaint seems to be that the battery life isn't the best (it's on the small side at 41WHr).\nWho should get this laptop?\nThis HP 15 Laptop is great for general family use, as a first or second house computer, couch surfing, students, or anyone who needs to get the basics done, such as Office, email, writing, web browsing, watching YouTube/Netflix, and other productivity tasks.\nDue to the 'meh' battery life plan to leave it plugged in most of the time, or when you only need a few hours of usage on-the-go.\nExpert reviewer\u2019s opinion\nLook, this isn\u2019t a super-premium laptop, but it\u2019s also no throw-away device, either. For $299, you get some solid internal hardware that won\u2019t make this laptop feel like a slouch, as the processor is found in $1,000+ laptops.\nAs someone who has handled a lot of budget laptops (I\u2019ve been on this site for 18 years now), I can tell you the biggest knock of them was performance. But with a Core i5, an SSD for storage, and fast RAM, when you combine that with a full HD display, you\u2019ll get a laptop that feels like something much more, and that\u2019s what matters for day-to-day use.\nWhen does Cyber Monday end?\nWhile Black Friday and Cyber Monday tend to start earlier each year, the worldwide sales event often ends on a similar note. Cyber Monday, which this year is Dec. 2, 2024, is the final day for many of the most major and aggressive sales and discounts from the deals bonanza. While some promotions may continue after Cyber Monday ends at Midnight on Dec. 2, you really shouldn't wait to take advantage of any deals that have caught your attention.\nWhen does Cyber Monday start?\nCyber Monday began as the online retailer equivalent of Black Friday, but most shopping has gone online over the last few years. This has resulted in Black Friday and Cyber Monday being blended into one massive sales event spread across an entire weekend, with Cyber Monday marking the tumultuous finale. This year, Cyber Monday falls on Dec. 2, 2024, which (as you might expect) is the Monday after Black Friday.\nIt's best to take advantage of sales you're interested in the moment you spot them to avoid stock shortages and limited-time discounts, but Cyber Monday does frequently boast its own batch of last-minute deals separate from Black Friday.\n\ud83d\udcbdMore last-minute Cyber Monday deals\ud83d\udcbe",
