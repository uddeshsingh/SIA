I have never really watched any of the \u2018Bachelor\u2019 series at all, but I found myself watching \u2018The Golden Bachelorette,\u2019 because I think she is precious,\" Suzanne said.\n\"There were so many widows on the show and a lot of the widows . . . on their sixth year of . . . losing their soul mates. And so, I really identified with the first \u2018Golden Bachelorette.\u2019\"\n\"Everything was so parallel . . . I think it's good.

I used to meet a lot of women in my age bracket, anywhere from about 45 [to] 55 years old, who are very active in yoga, running . . . they want to go hiking . . . camping . . . that's just not what I can do or want to do anymore.\"\nWATCH: \u2018LATER DATERS\u2019 CAST MEMBER NATE, 56, SAYS BEING A DISABLED VETERAN IS A \u2018FLAW\u2019 IN HIS LOVE LIFE\nNate said that he felt limited in the dating world because of his injuries, but admitted there were other mental challenges he faced, in part from physical factors.\n\"Mentally, . . . I wonder if they feel that I can still be a protector, because I do have a bad knee and bad back . . . I haven't had any problems before. But I think that's just one of those things that I have had to kind of deal with on my own and just say, . . . \u2018You are good enough\u2019 and you know somebody will understand it. . . . If they really care about you.\"\n\u2018Bachelor\u2019 Star's Promise To Abstain From Sex Before Marriage: It 'Wasn't Easy' But \u2018It Was Worth It\u2019\nOne of the eldest daters, Pam, 71, confessed that she had dedicated most of her life to being a part of the Civil Reserve Air Fleet, which hindered past marriages due to constant travel.\n\"It\u2019s difficult for me . . .

I was gone 21 days a month . . . in Dubai one day and then we were in the Philippines the next . . . we did rescue missions,\" she said to Fox News Digital.\n\"You met people, but we didn't date because we were there long enough to haul people on the plane and get out, because it was mostly . . . disasters like Mount Pinatubo, and it erupted . . . earthquakes. . . .\"\nWATCH: : \u2018LATER DATERS\u2019 CAST MEMBER PAM, 71, SHARES THE WORST DATE SHE\u2019S BEEN ON\nPam said that she had tried \"not to get attached to anyone.\"\n\"It's not like I could come back to the Philippines and see them again . . . they were mostly military people, too.
