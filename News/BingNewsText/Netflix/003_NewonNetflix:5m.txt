Her boss assigns an old friend, played by Ben Whishaw, to stick by her, but he's been out of the game so long he might be more liability than asset.\nAside from that, there's the usual mix of shows, documentaries, etc., arriving this week. But there is one new original movie of biblical proportions. \"Mary\" is a retelling of the Christian Nativity story, with Noa Cohen starring as Mary and Oscar-winner Anthony Hopkins as King Herod.\nFor more to watch, read on for our top picks for everything coming to Netflix this week. If you need more, then check out our guide to everything new to Netflix in December or read up on everything we know about \"Squid Game\" season 2, which is coming later this month.\nNew on Netflix this week: Top picks\n'Black Doves'\n\"Black Doves\" stars Keira Knightley as Helen Webb, a politician's wife and a loving mother. But she's hiding a dark secret \u2014 she's secretly a member of the Black Doves covert espionage agency and undercover spying on her politician husband for the past 10 years. Oh, and she's been having a secret affair with fellow Black Doves agent Jason (Andrew Koji) who she's very much in love with.\nBut her world is shattered when Jason is suddenly assassinated. That causes her boss, Reed (Sarah Lancashire), to call in Helen\u2019s old friend Sam (Ben Whishaw) to keep Helen safe. There's just one problem: Sam hasn't been a spy for some time and Helen wants revenge. So Sam may be more of a liability than an asset.\nWatch it on Netflix starting Dec. 5\n'Mary'\nThe Nativity story tells the birth of Jesus Christ and is fairly well known even to those outside of the Christian faith. After all, that's what Christmas is about.\n\"Mary\" is another retelling of this story, but focused on the early life of Jesus' mother Mary rather than solely on the birth of Christ. It's billed as a coming-of-age biblical epic about Mary (Noa Cohen) being shunned following her immaculate conception. When King Herod (Anthony Hopkins) ignites a murderous pursuit for the newborn baby Jesus, she, the baby and her husband Joseph (Ido Tako) are forced to go into hiding in Egypt to avoid Herod's wrath.\nWatch it on Netflix starting Dec. 6\n'A Nonsense Christmas with Sabrina Carpenter' live\n\"A Nonsense Christmas with Sabrina Carpenter\" has the pop star hosting her very first Christmas special. And it looks set to be a star-studded event, with highly-anticipated duets with Chappell Roan, Tyla, Shania Twain, and Kali Uchis and guest appearances from Nico Hiraga, Quinta Brunson, Cara Delevingne, Kyle Mooney, Megan Stalter, Sean Astin, Owen Thiele, and Jillian Bell.\nNetflix has dabbled in the celebrity Christmas special before, with 2015's \"A Very Murray Christmas.\" Like with that special, you should expect plenty of singing. But \"A Nonsense Christmas with Sabrina Carpenter\" is a variety show rather than a movie, so expect more of a late-night talk show feel to the event.\nWatch it live on Netflix starting Dec. 6 at 9 p.m. ET / 6 p.m. PT\n'Fortune Feimster: Crushing It'\nFortune Feimster is returning to Netflix this week with her third Netflix comedy special, \"Fortune Feimster: Crushing It.\" Her previous specials, \"Good Fortune\" (2022) and \"Sweet & Salty\" (2020) were critical hits for the streaming service, and it won't be a surprise if this special is a success as well.\nIn \"Crushing It,\" Fortune riffs on stories from her life, including her \u201cromantic\u201d honeymoon with her wife and her reflections on no longer being her mom\u2019s surrogate husband. She even spills the tea on why she had to unfriend her mom on Facebook. Don't miss this stand-up special when it arrives on Netflix this week.\nWatch it on Netflix starting Dec. 3\n'That Christmas'\nIf you're looking for a Christmas movie to watch with the whole family, then you'll want to hit play on \"That Christmas\" this week. Based on the Richard Curtis series of books \"That Christmas and Other Stories,\" the movie follows several connected stories about love, family, turkeys let loose on the town and Santa (Brian Cox) making a big mistake.\nYes, that's right. Logan Roy is voicing Santa Claus this Christmas season.
