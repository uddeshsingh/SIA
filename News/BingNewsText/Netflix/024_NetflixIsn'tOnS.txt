I was too, but after all of the news of ads being added, password-sharing crackdowns, and the addition of video games to the streaming services, I'm only expecting their prices to increase! Luckily, prices are going down on other major streaming services since Black Friday. And lucky for everyone, Netflix isn't the only streaming platform to offer outstanding TV shows or movies. So what are you waiting for? It's time to save and chill with these epic streaming sales.\nAnd don't forget to check out the Best Cyber Monday Deals Available Now.\nHulu\nHulu is at its lowest price of the year. You can stream everything Hulu has to offer for an entire year at just .99\u00a2 a month (with ads). You might even have $12 sitting in the cracks of your couch cushions, so you can definitely take the hit on your wallet. But if you're into bundling your streaming services (and who doesn't) Hulu is also offering their content with Disney+ at $2.99 a month. It's like a digital stocking stuffer for your .\nEither way you're saving at least 72% on Hulu, and that's an offer that only Santa can match (and you would have had to be extra special good this year). If you're on the fence about watching hits like the Emmy winner for Best Drama (Shogun, The Bear, Only Murders In the Building, just to name a few), keep in mind that Hulu is one of the best streaming services around. Our senior analyst, , praised the app in his , saying, \u201cHulu is an excellent choice for its combination of on-demand content and live TV.\u201d\nNote: This offer ends on December 2.\nDisney+\nDisney+ just pulled a classic buddy cop team-up for the best streaming service bundle deal yet. In this Disney+ plays the good cop and offers a team-up with Hulu and Max for as little as $2.99 a month. If you're looking to save on streaming, or if your kids are anything like my kids, then you're going to be sining Encanto way past December 2nd, which is when this deal ends.\nIt's almost always less expensive to stream in bundles. That's the impression we're getting since Disney+ is teaming up with Hulu for just $2.99 a month (with ads). And as if that's not enough, Disney+ is also offering an Avengers-sized group bundle with Hulu and Max for $16.99 a month (with ads). Both bundle packages are limited to 12 months, with there being an auto-renewal comes 2026 at a new price. Still, you can stream a lot of great content across all three streaming services throughout 2025. Our analysts Jordan Minor and gave Disney+ an 4-star Excellent rating in, highlighting Disney's vast entertainment catalog.\nNote: This offer ends on December 2.\nMax\nIf you're like me, and you crave comic book-related shows and movies, Max unleashed a deal so good that you won't have to share your Max password anymore with your fellow comic book friends.\nMax is one of the best streaming services around according to our analysts, who gave it an \"Excellent\" rating in , praising the service\u2019s deep library of content. With HBO originals like House of The Dragon, The Penguin, Hacks, and Dune: Prophecy along with classic hit series like The Wire, The Sopranos, and Sex in the City, it's no wonder why Max is so acclaimed. Add to that all the additional DC Universe content (like that three-part, animated Crisis on Infinite Earths), Turner Classic Movies, and Adult Swim content and then multiply it by live sports from MLB to college basketball. It's worth the $9.99 a month outside of a sale, but now, thanks to the Cyber Monday deal, you can enjoy Max at $2.99 a month for six months. That means you binge the greatest shows from the golden age of TV, for half of 2025 at a total price that's cheaper than two months of Max under a normal subscription.\nNote: This limited time deal is available now through Monday, December 2 for both new and returning subscribers to Max, Apple, Google Play, Roku, Samsung, and Xumo, and for new Max customers only on Amazon Fire TV.\nParamount+\nIn Star Trek lore, Klingons are rugged, ruthless warriors. They've done it all and seen it all, but this sale on Paramount+ could even surprise them. They might even say, \"mIw'a'na' DeHbe'law' DISov\" (We can't believe the savings).\nParamount+ continues to grow with many originals, like a slew of all-new Star Trek series (not to mention the old ones). The streaming service is a solid choice, but the key to it is getting Showtime. That's why our analysts and said in . Paramount+ \u201coffers popular original shows and live sports at a reasonable price, but you must pay for its most expensive tier to enjoy the best features.\u201d Well, it's not so expensive anymore.\nParamount's Cyber Monday deal with Showtime is now $2.99 for just two months. That's $20 off for two months. If you're not looking for Showtime originals, then Paramount+ Essential (with ads) is also $2.99 for just two months. If you option to go with the annual plan, you're still saving with the two-month discount overall. It's a good deal if you want to try out the streaming platform, because it will not get any cheaper to beam aboard the Enterprise.\nNote: This deal ends on December 4.\nPeacock\nGive yourself (or a loved one) the gift that keeps on giving: Yellowstone, as every season of the hit series is streaming now on Peacock. Consider it a great digital stocking stuffer for anyone on your shopping list.\nRight now you can sign up for an entire year of Peacock for $19.99. That's 75% off for a limited time, as their standard yearly offer is $79.99! If you're still on the fence about signing up, and watching hours and hours of Rip Wheeler punching his way through the Yellowstone ranch, consider how Peacock is also offering a bonkers deal of $1.99 for six months! And you can cancel anytime for either offer. You can spend the majority of 2025 watching Yellowstone and other hits like The Office, NFL's Sunday Night Football, the Premier League, SNL, WWE and so much more for as low as $1.99. If you go six or 12 months, you're getting a super discounted deal. Our experts gave the streaming service our Editors' Choice award in and praised Peacock's deep library, and outstanding HD stream quality.\nNote: This offer ends on December 2.\nESPN+\nESPN+, the home of every major UFC event, Monday Night Football, ESPN College Football, the NBA, Saturday Night Baseball, F1, and so many more sports, just changed the game entirely! They've slashed their annual subscription fee down to a hundred bucks (what it would typically cost for nine months). Game on! Deals on! Ring the bell!\nESPN+, which is normally bundled with Hulu or Disney+, just broke out something new from their playbook. You can sign up to the network's streaming service for $99.99 for an entire year. That means, for one year, you're getting all of the sports that are exclusive to ESPN, which is everything from every major UFC event (and who doesn't love a good fight?), to the Nathan's Hot Dog Eating Contest (who doesn't love a great eat-off?). While our analysts said in that the streaming platform may overall lack the the flagship programming you want like SportsCenter, it still has outstanding streaming quality and it's the only place to watch ESPN originals like 30 For 30.\nNote: Offer ends 12/2/24 at 11:59 p.m. EST.\nPLEX\nPlex isn't just a video streaming service. No, it also offers the ability to access your local media libraries on any device that has the Plex app. Say you have a large digital vault of files from movies, shows, and music, and they\u2019re all in a variety of file types (MP3, M4A, FLAC, etc). Plex lets you stream all of that content across all your devices and share that content with other people on the Plex app. The Plex Pass is easy to set up, too.

It's the Plex feature that I'm most familiar with as I have streamed and searched through their free content with ads and watched classic films like Raging Bull, and scrolled through their rental library like Beetlejuice Beetlejuice.\nThe lifetime pass, however, is about giving advanced users who no longer have the space or desire to host their massive personal libraries. In our , our analysts gave Plex a 4.0 saying it\u2019s \u201cthe slickest solution\u201d to access your local content.
