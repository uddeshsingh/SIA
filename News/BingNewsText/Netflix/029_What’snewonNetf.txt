    "maintext": "'Twas the night before Christmas, when all through the streamer, more new titles were stirring, (janky boxing not featured) \u2014 from TV, to movies and comedy specials to anime, reality, the NFL, and much more, the offerings were splendid with stars and drama galore!\nDecember is on our doorstep, and Netflix is prepared with a calendar full of bingeable favorites and intriguing new titles alike. This year's standout titles include the highly anticipated second season of Squid Game, the South Korean thriller that set the world on fire in 2021. There's also Maria, the latest look at a glamorous grieving lady from Pablo Larra\u00edn (Jackie, Spencer). The Maria Callas biopic electrified the Venice International Film Festival back in August and is already garnering Best Actress Oscar buzz for star Angelina Jolie.\nBeyond the typical movie and TV beat, there are three specials sure to attract millions of eyeballs when they drop next month: A Nonsense Christmas with Sabrina Carpenter follows in the footsteps of 2019's Kacey Musgraves Christmas Show, teaming the \"Espresso\" pop star with guests like Chappell Roan, Shania Twain, and Kali Uchis to sing a medley of holiday classics. Jamie Foxx: What Had Happened Was... marks the Academy Award winner's return to the comedy stage after an extended bout with a still-undisclosed health issue last spring. Finally, Netflix fully moves into the sporting arena by becoming the exclusive streaming home of two Christmas NFL games.\nElsewhere on the calendar for next month, Tyler Perry debuts The Six Triple Eight, a new historical drama starring Kerry Washington, and Carry-On teams Taron Egerton and Jason Bateman for a Christmas Eve-set thriller centered on a bad TSA experience. The horror! There are also four other comedy specials beyond Foxx's, from Fortune Feimster, Ronny Chieng, Nate Bargatze, and Michelle Buteau.\nBrand new international films and series promise something for every type of viewer. For the history buff, Italy's The Children's Train; for the hopeless romantic, South Africa's Umjolo: Day Ones; for the fan of Hunger Games-style dystopic class war, Thailand's Tomorrow + I; and for the literary-minded, Colombia's adaptation of Gabriel Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez's One Hundred Years of Solitude.\nTV programming is where things get really interesting. We have Kiera Knightley leading a new spy thriller called Black Doves, a new serial killer series from horror maestro Alex De La Iglesia, the wild true crime docuseries The Kings of Tupelo, and the frontrunner in most stacked cast of the year, No Good Deed, a series that features Ray Romano, Denis Leary, Linda Cardellini, Luke Wilson, Abbi Jacobson, Teyonah Harris, Lisa Kudrow, Linda Lavin, and more in a dark comedy about the petit bourgeoisie.\nFinally, you can look forward to new seasons of The Great British Baking Show: Holidays, Queer Eye (featuring new host Jeremiah Brent after Bobby Berk exited last year), The Manny, and Virgin River. All this and more are coming to a small screen near you.\nHere are all of the new movies and shows coming to Netflix in December.\nDec. 1\nBunk'd: Season 7\nBurlesque\nDaddy Day Care\nThe Happytime Murders\nLittle\nMidway\nProject X\nWe're the Millers\nZero Dark Thirty\nDec. 2\n30 for 30: Bad Boys\n30 for 30: Celtics/Lakers: The Best of Enemies\n30 for 30: Sole Man\n30 for 30: This Magic Moment\n30 for 30: This Was the XFL\n30 for 30: Winning Time: Reggie Miller vs. The New York Knicks\nDec. 3\nFortune Feimster: Crushing It\nDec. 4\nThe Children's Train\nChurchill at War\nThe Only Girl in the Orchestra\nTomorrow and I\nThat Christmas\nThe Ultimatum: Marry or Move On: Season 3\nDec. 5\nBEASTARS: Final Season: Part 1\nBlack Doves\nCompliance\nJentry Chau vs the Underwold\nSubservience\nTop Chef: Boston\nTop Chef: Kentucky\nTop Chef: Seattle\nDec. 6\nA Nonsense Christmas with Sabrina Carpenter\nBiggest Heist Ever\nCamp Crasher\nEchoes of the Past\nMary\nDec. 9\nThe Great British Baking Show: Holidays: Season 7\nDec. 10\nJamie Foxx: What Had Happened Was...\nPolo\nRugged Rugby: Conquer or Die\nDec. 11\nThe Kings of Tupelo: A Southern Crime Saga\nMakayla's Voice: A Letter to the World\nMaria\nOne Hundred Years of Solitude: Part 1\nQueer Eye: Season 9\nDec. 12\nLa Palma\nNo Good Deed\nDec. 13\n1992\nCarry-On\nDisaster Holiday\nDec. 16\nThe Dead Don't Die\nThe Equalizer: Seasons 1-3\nDec. 17\nAaron Rodgers: Enigma\nRonny Chieng: Love to Hate It\nDec. 18\nJulia's Stepping Stones\nThe Manny: Season 2\nDec. 19\nThe Dragon Prince: Season 7\nVirgin River: Season 6\nDec. 20\nFerry 2\nThe Six Triple Eight\nUmjolo: Day Ones\nUniverXO Dabiz\nDec. 21\nFlipping Out: Seasons 6-8\nDec. 24\nYour Friend Nate Bargatze\nDec. 25\nNFL on Christmas: Baltimore Ravens vs. Houston Texans\nNFL on Christmas: Kansas City Chiefs vs. Pittsburgh Steelers\nDec. 26\nSquid Game: Season 2\nDec. 28\nMaestro in Blue: Season 3\nDec. 30\nMad Max: Fury Road\nDec. 31\nAvicii - I'm Tim\nAvicii - My Last Show\nEvil: Season 3\nMichelle Buteau: A Buteau-ful Mind at Radio City Music Hall\nThe Millionaire Matchmaker: Seasons 5-7",
