TechRadar's entertainment experts have put in the hard yards to compile a list of the 42 best movies to watch on Netflix, including a number of the streamer's original offerings and plenty of licensed ones. The streamer has a seemingly immeasurable number of films to choose from these days, so we're sure you'll be glad of our help.\nIf you want even more recommendations, you should read our everything new on Netflix in November 2024 guide and if you want to catch some movies before they bid farewell to the streamer this month, then have a look at everything leaving Netflix in November 2024. It's packed with numerous new movies that have made their way onto the streamer over the past month, including these four new Netflix movies with over 81% on Rotten Tomatoes. However, if you're in the mood to binge watch a TV show or rather focus on something shorter, then check out our best Netflix TV shows to watch list.\nFrom animated flicks to war epics, Netflix's movie library has something for everyone and we've made it easier for you to decide what to watch by picking out the best from each genre, so read on to get the lowdown on the best Netflix films available to you.\nBest action movies on Netflix\nBaby Driver\nAge rating: R\nRuntime: 113 minutes\nMain cast: Ansel Elgort, Lily James, Jon Hamm, Kevin Spacey, Jamie Foxx, Eiza Gonz\u00e1lez and Jon Bernthal\nDirector: Edgar Wright\nRT score: 92%\nRecommended by\nRecommended by\nMatt Bolton\nFamed British filmmaker Edgar Wright (Scott Pilgrim vs the World, Shaun of the Dead) put pedal to the metal with this barnstorming high-octane action-thriller, and I've loved it since I saw it in the theater. Elgort plays 'Baby', a getaway driver who relies on the beat of his personal soundtrack to get his crew of goons out of a jam whenever he's needed. However, when he falls for Debora (James), the woman of his dreams, 'Baby' sees a way out of his crime-based life for good \u2013 but naturally, he's forced into one final job, which threatens the freedom and clean slate he desperately craves. I think it's one of the most slick and stylish flicks we've had in years, and Wright's signature kinetic style elevates it beyond other simple action fare. I also love the soundtrack, which is woven right into the action, like the action version of a musical. Baby Driver is a pulsating, thrills-a-minute ride that deserves more recognition.\n\u2022 Watch Baby Driver on Netflix now\n\u2022 Watch Baby Driver's trailer on YouTube\nAll Quiet on the Western Front\nAge rating: R\nRuntime: 148 minutes\nMain cast: Felix Kammerer, Albrecht Schuch, Aaron Hilmer, and Moritz Klaus Director: Edward Berger\nRT score: 90%\nGet the best Black Friday deals direct to your inbox, plus news, reviews, and more.\nSign up to be the first to know about unmissable Black Friday deals on top tech, plus get all your favorite TechRadar content.\nContact me with news and offers from other Future brands Receive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsors\nRecommended by\nRecommended by\nTom Power\nIt\u2019s been a good few years since Dunkirk and 1917 reminded audiences of the horrors of war, but Netflix assumed that responsibility with shocking but beautifully-made WWI epic, All Quiet on the Western Front. Based on Erich Maria Remarque\u2019s landmark novel of the same name (which was first adapted into a feature film in 1930), this award-winning German-language movie tells the story of a young German soldier (Felix Kammerer) whose naive expectations of fighting for his country are shattered by war\u2019s harrowing reality. As you'd expect, All Quiet on the Western Front is brutal, vivid and poignant \u2013 just don\u2019t expect to reach its credits feeling particularly joyous.\n\u2022 Watch All Quiet on the Western Fronton Netflix now\n\u2022 Watch All Quiet on the Western Front's YouTube trailer\nThe Harder They Fall\nAge rating: R\nRuntime: 139 minutes\nMain cast: Idris Elba, Jonathan Majors, Zazie Beetz, Delroy Lindo, and LaKeith Stanfield\nDirector: Jeymes Samuel\nRT score: 88%\nRecommended by\nRecommended by\nTom Power\nJeymes Samuel's feature film directorial debut wasn't expected to be this good. But The Harder They Fall, which stars the likes of Idris Elba, Zazie Beetz, and Regina King, is a superb Western that deserves your attention. Jonathan Majors, who was recently found guilty of domestic abuse and whose career is effectively over as a result, plays Nat Love, an outlaw who discover his mortal enemy Rufus Black (Elba) is being released from prison. Unsurprisingly, Love takes the law into his own hands and assembles his crack team of gunslingers to stop that from happening. A stylized, gun-toting action flick that's somewhat predictable in its makeup, The Harder They Fall will have you whooping and hollering at the screen regularly.\n\u2022 Watch The Harder They Fallon Netflix now\n\u2022 Watch The Harder They Fall's YouTube trailer\nBest animated movies on Netflix\nApollo 10 1/2: A Space Age Childhood\nAge rating: PG-13\nRuntime: 98 minutes\nMain cast: Jack Black, Bill Wise, Lee Eddy, Milo Coy, Zachary Levi, and Glen Powell Director: Richard Linklater\nRT score: 91%\nRecommended by\nRecommended by\nTom Power\nNetflix is home to lots of great animated flicks, so if you\u2019re keen to mix up your movie-watching diet, films don't come much more unconventional than the streamer\u2019s Apollo 10 1/2: A Space Age Childhood. Boyhood director Richard Linklater returns to filmmaking duties with this animated feature, which tells the story of the 1969 moon landing from multiple perspectives. The movie shares the visual style of Linklater\u2019s previous animation, 2006's A Scanner Darkly, and features the voice talents of The Super Mario Bros. Movie's Jack Black, Shazam! Fury of the Gods' Zachary Levi, and Top Gun: Maverick star Glen Powell. Despite its needlessly lengthy title, Apollo 10 1/2 is a genuinely unique take on one of history\u2019s most iconic moments, and serves as yet more proof of Netflix's willingness to invest in boundary-pushing storytelling.\n\u2022 Watch Apollo 10 1/2: A Space Age Childhood on Netflix now\n\u2022 Watch Apollo 10 1/2: A Space Age Childhood's trailer on YouTube\nGuillermo del Toro's Pinocchio\nAge rating: PG\nRuntime: 121 minutes\nMain cast: Gregory Mann, Ewan McGregor, David Bradley, Tilda Swinton, Cate Blanchett, and Finn Holfhard\nDirectors: Guillermo del Toro and Mark Gustafson\nRT score: 96%\nRecommended by\nRecommended by\nTom Power\nWho says Netflix has lost its taste for originality? With Guillermo del Toro\u2019s Pinocchio, the streamer breathes new life into Carlo Collodi's beloved 1883 fairytale about a wooden puppet who longs to become a real boy. Shot entirely using stop-motion (in a manner akin to Netflix series The House), del Toro\u2019s darker adaptation is set in 1930s Italy during Mussolini\u2019s fascist regime and features a star-studded voice cast that includes Ewan McGregor, David Bradley, Tilda Swinton, Christoph Waltz and Cate Blanchett.

Halfway through this fraught journey, an AI takes revenge on its billionaire creator and the world is suddenly under duress from smart robots. A lot of Spider-Verse's visual touches cross over into this film, with 2D annotations and drawings on the already-pretty 3D visuals. Most of all, it's nice to see Netflix backing a family movie that's not just full of talking dogs and other hackneyed nonsense so often seen in CG kids' fare.\n\u2022 Watch The Mitchells vs the Machines' on Netflix now\n\u2022 Watch The Mitchells vs the Machines' YouTube trailer\nNimona\nAge rating: PG\nRuntime: 102 minutes\nMain cast: Chloe Grace Moretz, Riz Ahmed, Eugene Lee Yang, and Frances Conroy\nDirectors: Nick Bruno and Troy Quane\nRT score: 92%\nRecommended by\nRecommended by\nTom Power\nBased on ND Stevenson's 2015 graphic novel of the same name, Nimona is a delightfully fun, action-packed, funny, and heartfelt flick that's also unapologetically queer. Star Wars alumnus Riz Ahmed voices Ballister Blackheart, a futuristic knight who's framed for a crime he didn't commit. The only witness who can save him from a lengthy jail term is Nimona (The Peipheral's Chloe Grace Moretz), a shapeshifter who Blackheart is sworn to seek out and destroy. Cue a wild buddy cop-style adventure that teaches kids to have an open mind about people who are different to them in more ways than one. Nimona has been lauded for its LGBTQ+ representation, subversive storytelling, and gorgeous visuals among many other positives.

Directed by Oscar-winning filmmaker Chris Williams (Moana, Big Hero Six), the movie follows Jacob Holland (voiced by The Boys\u2019 Karl Urban), a celebrated sea monster hunter whose life is upended when a young girl, Maisie Brumble (newcomer Zaris-Angel Hator), stows away on his ship. Charming, action-packed, and beautifully-rendered, The Sea Beast was praised by audiences and critics alike upon release, and serves as further proof that Netflix should think twice about scaling back its animation department. If it still is, that is.\n\u2022 Watch The Sea Beast on Netflix now\n\u2022 Watch The Sea Beast's trailer on YouTube\nSpider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse\nAge rating: PG\nRuntime: 140 minutes\nMain cast: Shameik Moore, Hailee Steinfeld, Oscar Isaac, Jake Johnson, Luna Lauren Velez, Bryan Tyree Henry, Issa Rae, Daniel Kaluuya, and Jason Schwartzman\nDirectors: Kemp Powers, Joaquin Dos Santos, and Justin K.

Set 14 months after Into the Spider-Verse, viewers are reunited with Miles Morales, Gwen Stacey, and Peter B Parker as they embark on a new multiverse-spanning journey that, unlike its forebear, won't be such an easy one to navigate. In my Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse review, I said it \"fulfils its ambitious promise to deliver an amazing follow-up to its 2018 predecessor\".

Against the odds, the pair must work to prove that they both deserve to make it big in the NBA.

This Indonesian flick centers on four retired assassins who are thrust back into the game when they meet a strait-laced detective determined to catch a mysterious killer. It's one of four action comedies with over 85% on Rotten Tomatoes and has everything I could want from the genre, with outrageous action sequences, hilarious banter and a bunch of misfit characters that will have you in fits of laughter.\n\u2022 Watch The Big 4 on Netflix now\n\u2022 Watch The Big 4 trailer on YouTube\nHit Man\nAge rating: R\nRuntime: 116 minutes\nMain cast: Glen Powell, Adria Arjona, Austin Amelio, Molly Kate Bernard, Retta and Evan Holtzman\nDirector: Richard Linklater\nRT score: 95%\nRecommended by\nRecommended by\nGrace Morris\nOne of Netflix's highly-anticipated new movies was Hit Man, which definitely proved to be a hit, man! The twisted comedy went down a treat with its 95% Rotten Tomatoes score and spent three weeks at the number one spot in the Netflix Global top 10 list when it was released in June. Glen Powell stars as Gary Johnson, an undercover agent who poses as a fake hitman to help a woman in need and soon finds himself falling for her. It\u2019s a deceptively dark thriller that\u2019s packed with drama and romance, which is bound to bring entertainment to any night of the week.

Brown plays the titular character (and younger sister of Cavill's Sherlock), who travels to London to locate her missing mother. Unsurprisingly, she gets side-tracked, and finds herself teaming up with a runaway lord to get to the bottom of a particularly thrilling case that threatens the UK. A breezy but fun-filled adventure flick, Enola Holmes bubbles away nicely with its more than entertaining narrative, which is ably led by Brown's effervescent Holmes. Its sequel is also available to stream on Netflix.\n\u2022 Watch Enola Holmeson Netflix now\n\u2022 Watch Enola Holmes' YouTube trailer\nThe Irishman\nAge rating: R\nRuntime: 209 minutes\nMain cast: Robert De Niro, Joe Pesci, Al Pacino, and Anna Paquin\nDirector: Martin Scorsese\nRT score: 95%\nRecommended by\nRecommended by\nTom Power\nThis threateningly long Scorsese pic attracted attention for the extensive effects work used to de-age its old stars, and it's a creative decision that's sometimes distracting. But there's no denying the appeal of seeing Robert De Niro, Joe Pesci, and Al Pacino in the same movie together for likely the last time, and this life-spanning, mostly rewarding crime epic is a suitable tribute to their collective talents. The Irishman is an unmissable crime movie that follows Frank Sheeran (De Niro) as he recounts his long association with the Bufalino crime family and infamous union leader Jimmy Hoffa (Pacino). It's a languid film \u2013 and not a patch on Goodfellas \u2013 but absolutely among the best Netflix movies the streaming service has financed to date.

As well as referring to the infamous goal scored by Argentine footballer (and Napoli legend) Diego Maradona at the 1986 World Cup, the film's title alludes to a tragic and life-affirming event that forces its protagonist to grow up quicker than he'd otherwise like. To say more risks spoiling The Hand of God's most tender moments, though the movie's beautiful locations, hypnotic camerawork, and larger-than-life characters ensure it ranks among Sorrentino's best work.\n\u2022 Watch The Hand of Godon Netflix now\n\u2022 Watch The Hand of God's YouTube trailer\nMa Rainey's Black Bottom\nAge rating: R\nRuntime: 94 minutes\nMain cast: Viola Davis, Chadwick Boseman, Glynn Turman, and Colman Domingo\nDirector: George C.

Viola Davis stars as legendary 'Mother of Blues' Ma Rainey, with the film focusing on one fraught recording session with Ma and her band, and the tension between the musician and her white producers and management. The late Chadwick Boseman (Black Panther) stars as Levee, an innovative trumpet player who struggles to find his place in the music scene, amid bandmates who don't always take him seriously. It's a sad but insightful movie that explores how culture is worth protecting and valuing, in a world where it's easily taken and monetized, and the film truly comes to life in its amazing musical sequences.\n\u2022 Watch Ma Rainey's Black Bottomon Netflix now\n\u2022 Watch Ma Rainey's Black Bottom's YouTube trailer\nMolly's Game\nAge rating: R\nRuntime: 140 minutes\nMain cast: Jessica Chastain, Idris Elba, Kevin Costner, Michael Cera, Jeremy Strong\nDirector: Aaron Sorkin\nRT score: 81%\nRecommended by\nRecommended by\nAmelia Schwanke\nI love a movie with witty fast-paced dialogue and Molly's Game has this in spades. It's a trademark of Aaron Sorkin, who has proved to be an expert in creating razor sharp scripts after penning Charlie Wilson's War, Money Ball, Steve Jobs, The Social Network, A Few Good Men, The West Wing and The Trial of the Chicago 7 (just to name a few). For his directorial debut, he couldn't have chosen a more stranger than fiction story than that of the real-life Poker Princess, Molly Bloom. This biopic crime drama is dripping in mystery, suspense and intrigue. It takes you into the world of the most exclusive high rollers from all walks of life, from rock stars and athletes to FBI agents and Russian mafia, and while it's of course dramatized, it does (largely) stay true to what really happened. Don't believe me that this is a great watch?

No Time to Die's Cary Fukunaga directs this harrowing feature, which follows the journey of a young orphan (Abraham Attah) forced into becoming a child soldier by a fierce warlord (Idris Elba) during an unnamed African civil war. An adaptation of Uzodinma Iweala's novel of the same name, Beasts of No Nation is a masterfully-shot story documenting the human cost of conflict, and places the uncomfortable realities of war front and centre. This isn't one to watch with the kids, but sitting through its two-hour narrative is an enlightening, dare-we-say necessary movie experience.\n\u2022 Watch Beasts of No Nationon Netflix now\n\u2022 Watch Beasts of No Nation's YouTube trailer\nThe Power of the Dog\nAge rating: R\nRuntime: 128 minutes\nMain cast: Benedict Cumberbatch, Kristen Dunst, Jesse Plemons, and Kodi Smit-McPhee\nDirector: Jane Campion\nRT score: 94%\nRecommended by\nRecommended by\nTom Power\nIt\u2019s safe to say that Jane Campion\u2019s The Power of the Dog was the critical hit \u2013 and one of the best Netflix movies \u2013 of 2021. Widely praised for its slow-burning psychological drama, it follows the story of a menacing rancher (Benedict Cumberbatch) who doesn\u2019t take kindly to the arrival of his brother\u2019s new wife (Kirsten Dunst) and her son (Kodi Smit-McPhee). Cumberbatch arguably gives a career-best performance as the volatile Phil Burbank here, which undoubtedly made interesting prep for Doctor Strange 2. It's a slow-burner, but The Power of the Dog is a masterful piece of filmmaking.\n\u2022 Watch The Power of the Dogon Netflix now\n\u2022 Watch The Power of the Dog's YouTube trailer\nPhantom Thread\nAge rating: R\nRuntime: 130 minutes\nMain cast: Daniel Day Lewis, Vicky Krieps, Lesley Manville, and Camilla Rutherford\nDirector: Paul Thomas Anderson\nRT score: 91%\nRecommended by\nRecommended by\nTom Power\nShortly after Licorice Pizza \u2013 director Paul Thomas Anderson's most recent flick \u2013 hit 2023's awards circuit, Netflix added his previous film Phantom Thread to its library. This one tells the story of a dressmaker (Daniel Day-Lewis) in 1950s London who falls for a young waitress (Vicky Krieps). That might sound like a potentially boring narrative, but Phantom Thread is actually masterfully-shot. It's also a poignant exploration of what it means to be an artist, combining Oscar-winning costume design with a stunning soundtrack (from Radiohead and frequent Anderson collaborator Johnny Greenwood) to rank among its director's finest work. One of the best Netflix movies, this certainly is.\n\u2022 Watch Phantom Threadon Netflix now\n\u2022 Watch Phantom Thread's YouTube trailer\nRoma\nAge rating: R\nRuntime: 134 minutes\nMain cast: Yalitza Aparicio, Marina de Tavira, Marco Graf, Fernando Grediaga, and Daniela Demesa\nDirector: Alfonso Cuaron\nRT score: 96%\nRecommended by\nRecommended by\nTom Power\nAn astonishing ode to motherhood in all forms, Roma is the most personal film to date from visionary director Alfonso Cuar\u00f3n (Children of Men, Gravity). On paper, it's is not the easiest sell \u2013 a subtitled black and white film about a live-in housekeeper spoken almost entirely in Spanish and the indigenous Mixtec language. But Cuar\u00f3n's 2018 critical hit is nonetheless riveting from a cinematic standpoint.

Bayona\u2019s latest flick \u2013 based on real-life events \u2013 is a harrowing portrayal of human endurance and how our primal survival instincts assume dominance over our humanity. Society of the Snow tells the tragic story of the 1972 Andes Air Disaster, which saw a Uruguayan rugby team crash-land in the freezing South American mountain range en route to a Chile-based tournament. Trapped in one of the most inhospitable places on Earth, the 16 survivors are forced to take extreme measures in order to stay alive.

Set in the Irish Midlands in 1862, the movie stars Pugh as an English nurse called to observe a young girl (K\u00edla Lord Cassidy) who remains miraculously alive and well despite not having eaten for four months.

With a cast of two people (plus an uncredited role for Duplass' real-life spouse), they've managed to make something truly unsettling.

And, in short, it did. Set across three flicks, the Fear Street series \u2013 itself based on R.L. Stine's books of the same name \u2013 told the story of a group of 90s-era teens as they attempt to break a curse that's loomed over their town for over 300 years. With lashings of the supernatural and witchcraft, R-rated slasher violence, an intriguing narrative, and more than a few notable faces \u2013 Stranger Things' Sadie Sink and Maya Hawke are among its cast \u2013 the Fear Street movies are well worth watching.\n\u2022 Watch Fear Street Part 1 on Netflix now\n\u2022 Watch Fear Street Part 1's YouTube trailer\nHis House\nAge rating: TV-14\nRuntime: 93 minutes\nMain cast: Wunmi Mosaku and Sope Dirisu\nDirector: Remi Weekes\nRT score: 100%\nRecommended by\nRecommended by\nTom Power\nThis Weekes-directed movie stars Mosaku (Loki) and Dirisu (Gangs of London) as Rial and Bol, a refugee couple from South Sudan who struggle to adjust to their new life in the UK. The overriding issue? The duo believe there's an evil supernatural force haunting their council home and the surrounding area. His House might not sound all that thrilling, but you'll want to give it a chance, trust us. Mosaku and Dirisu deliver powerhouse performances in this occasionally terrifying movie that, like Get Out, has plenty of important things to say about cultural and socio-political divides.

Based on Jenny Han's book trilogy, To All the Boys I've Loved Before follows teenager Lara Jean Covey (Lana Condor) whose unassuming life is upended when her secret love letters are mailed out to every boy she's ever loved. The hit love story refreshed the rom-com genre and developed a cult following with its realistic depiction of teenage life and high school relationships. To All the Boys I've Loved Before is a top tier feel good movie and is one of the best Netflix teen movies with its lovable and relatable characters.\n\u2022 Watch To All the Boys I've Loved Beforeon Netflix now\n\u2022 Watch To All the Boys I've Loved Before's YouTube trailer\nBest sci-fi movies on Netflix\nUpgrade\nAge rating: R\nRuntime: 100 minutes\nMain cast: Logan Marshall-Green, Harrison Gilbertson, Betty Gabriel, Melanie Vallejo and Benedict Hardie\nDirector: Leigh Whannell\nRT score: 88%\nRecommended by\nRecommended by\nMatt Bolton\nUpgrade is something that was desperately needed to refresh streaming action movies. I sorely miss genre-based action thrillers in the mainstream cinema landscape that are visually interesting and build on underlying themes, but Upgrade soon answered my prayers. Saw and Insidious writer Leigh Whannel's polished and tense direction makes this movie inventive yet still manages to tie into the memorable plot. In Upgrade, Grey Trace (Logan Marshall-Green) is left paralyzed in hospital after a deadly mugging which killed his wife. He's offered the chance to walk again by implanting an artificial intelligence chip called STEM and he soon develops superhuman strength. As he seeks revenge on the attackers who ruined his life, he becomes a brutal killing machine with the help of STEM. The cyberpunk action flick is still etched into my mind with its stylish cinematography, dark twists and jaw-dropping action sequences, which makes it definitely worth watching.\n\u2022 Watch Upgrade on Netflix now\n\u2022 Watch Upgrade's trailer on YouTube\nGodzilla Minus One\nAge rating: PG-13\nRuntime: 125 minutes\nMain cast: Ry\u00fbnosuke Kamiki, Minami Hamabe, Munetaka Aoki, Hidetaka Yoshioka, and Yuki Yamada\nDirector: Takashi Yamazaki\nRT score: 98%\nRecommended by\nRecommended by\nTom Power\nFew movies have recently spawned as many \u201cwhere can I stream it?\u201d questions as Godzilla Minus One. Finally, though, months after the unexpectedly successful film\u2019s theatrical release, Netflix has not only secured its streaming rights, but it also surprisingly dropped the sci-fi horror epic on its platform in early June. A new Japanese entry in Godzilla\u2019s packed back catalogue, Minus One returns to the iconic kaiju\u2019s roots with a destruction-filled and trauma-inducing tale set in post-war Japan. In it, the island nation desperately wrestles with the titanic monster\u2019s emergence from the deep and subsequently terrifying rampage across the Asian country. Easily one of 2023\u2019s best movies, Godzilla Minus One is a thematically rich, harrowing, and occasionally jaw-dropping spectacle.

It tells the bizarre tale of a young girl Mija and her best pal, an enormous creature called Okja, whose friendship comes under threat when a nasty CEO (Tilda Swinton) has evil plans for the titular animal. It's a refreshing movie with a nice angle of animal activism \u2013 a very different proposition to Parasite, for sure, but one that also demonstrates the director's ability to blend genres.\n\u2022 Watch Okja on Netflix now\n\u2022 Watch Okja's YouTube trailer\nThey Cloned Tyrone\nAge rating: R\nRuntime: 119 minutes\nMain cast: John Boyega, Jamie Foxx, and Teyonah Parris\nDirector: Juel Taylor\nRT score: 95%\nRecommended by\nRecommended by\nTom Power\nThey Cloned Tyrone is an absolutely brilliant movie. To discuss its plot at length is to spoil its biggest surprises, but here's a brief synopsis to give you a flavor of what to expect: \"A series of eerie events thrusts an unlikely trio (Jamie Foxx, John Boyega, and Teyonah Parris) onto the trail of a nefarious government conspiracy in this pulpy mystery caper.\" We thoroughly enjoyed what it has to offer on multiple levels and our exclusive chat with John Boyega is well worth reading for a peak behind the curtain on its production.

The crime thriller is based on a 1978 episode of The Dating Game where the seemingly normal Rodney Alcala (Daniel Zovatto) appeared alongside contestant Sheryl Bradshaw (Kendrick). However, Alcala was not the unassuming bachelor he portrayed on TV. In reality, he was actually a serial killer in the midst of a murder spree and went on the show to find his potential next murder victim. As a fan of Kendrick in Pitch Perfect and A Simple Favor, I was interested to see her tackle true crime and it most certainly paid off. The insane creep factor in Woman of the Hour was enough to make the hairs on the back of my neck stand up, and her sharp social commentary on how women are treated in the entertainment industry is a much-needed wake-up call. TechRadar's senior entertainment writer Lucy Buglass revealed that it's the scariest movie she's seen in 2024 so far and it's not even a horror, so what are you waiting for?\n\u2022 Watch Woman of the Hour on Netflix now\n\u2022 Watch the Woman of the Hour YouTube trailer\nA Simple Favor\nAge rating: R\nRuntime: 117 minutes\nMain cast: Anna Kendrick, Blake Lively, Henry Golding, Linda Cardellini, Dustin Milligan, Ava LaFramboise, Rupert Friend, Jean Smart, Ian Ho and Joshua Satine\nDirector: Paul Feig\nRT score: 84%\nRecommended by\nRecommended by\nGrace Morris\nIf you mix scandal, lies and secrets with a stylish suburban neo-noir then you get the cocktail that is A Simple Favor. Two women are at the center of intrigue in Paul Feig\u2019s mystery thriller when single mother Stephanie (Anna Kendrick) becomes friends with the mysterious Emily (Blake Lively) who suddenly disappears without a trace. When Stephanie goes on a mission to track her down, she stumbles upon something far more sinister than she could ever imagine. Lively is delicious as the scene-stealing femme fatale of Emily whose razor-sharp remarks and brilliantly bizarre behavior is topped off with jaw-dropping outfits and a 1960s French pop soundtrack.\n\u2022 Watch A Simple Favoron Netflix now\n\u2022 Watch A Simple Favor's YouTube trailer\nEmily the Criminal\nAge rating: R\nRuntime: 97 minutes\nMain cast: Aubrey Plaza, Theo Rossi, Gina Gershon, Brandon Sklenar, Megalyn Echikunwoke and Jonathan Avigdori\nDirector: John Patton Ford\nRT score: 94%\nRecommended by\nRecommended by\nMatt Bolton\nEmily the Criminal sees Aubrey Plaza take on the role of Emily, a college graduate who is struggling to find work due to her criminal record. In a desperate bid to make money, she becomes involved in a credit card fraud scheme which swiftly goes off the rails when she becomes romantically involved with the organizer. Plaza expertly embodies the despair that forces Emily to the lowest level of crime and is a gripping story of someone escaping constant turmoil.

Phillips and his crew are defenceless against the brutality of pirate captain Abduwali Muse (Barkhad Abdi) and his group as Phillips must work out a way to ensure everyone's safety. On top of Hanks' powerful performance of an everyday man thrown into a life or death situation, Jason Bourne director Paul Greengrass kept me in suspense though his shaky camerawork, heart-pounding action and realistic characters.\n\u2022 Watch Captain Phillipson Netflix now\n\u2022 Watch Captain Phillips' YouTube trailer\nGlass Onion: A Knives Out Mystery\nAge rating: PG-13\nRuntime: 141 minutes\nMain cast: Daniel Craig, Edward Norton, Janelle Monae, Kathryn Hahn, Dave Bautista, Kate Hudson, and Leslie Odom Jr\nDirector: Rian Johnson\nRT score: 92%\nRecommended by\nRecommended by\nTom Power\nKnives Out wowed fans and critics alike in 2019, so sequels were inevitable. The first of those \u2013 Glass Onion: A Knives Out Mystery \u2013 is another elaborate and highly entertaining whodunnit from director Rian Johnson. Buoyed by its excellent ensemble cast and a confidence carried over from its predecessor\u2019s success, Glass Onion is even showier and bolder than Knives Out \u2013 though the film proved exceptionally divisive among fans of Benoit Blanc's debut outing upon release.\n\u2022 Watch Glass Onion on Netflix now\n\u2022 Watch Glass Onion's YouTube trailer\nJaws\nAge rating: PG\nRuntime: 124 minutes\nMain cast: Roy Scheider, Robert Shaw, Richard Dreyfuss, Lorraine GaryDirector: Steven Spielberg\nRT score: 97%\nRecommended by\nRecommended by\nAmelia Schwanke\nThere are thousands of classic movies that many consider essential watches and Jaws is one of those films that tends to be on most peoples' lists, so when I saw that it was part of everything new on Netflix in September, it had to be added to our best of the best picks. It's one of the most highly rated new movies coming to Netflix in September and still stands up today as a tense watch \u2013 even if the pacing is of its time. It's a testament to Steven Spielberg's filmmaking because the plot is very simple: it's about a sheriff, marine biologist and fisherman that go on the hunt to find a great white shark that's been attacking locals of a beach community. Indeed, the animatronic shark that's famously nicknamed Bruce isn't very convincing anymore but it's no less iconic.\n\u2022 Watch Jaws on Netflix now\n\u2022 Watch the Jaws trailer on YouTube\nOldboy\nAge rating: R\nRuntime: 120 minutes\nMain cast: Choi Min-sik, Yoo Ji-tae, Kang Hye-jeong, Kim Byeong-Ok\nDirector: Park Chan-wook\nRT score: 83%\nRecommended by\nRecommended by\nAmelia Schwanke\nOldboy is a masterpiece that will haunt you long after the final credits roll \u2013 seriously, it really will. It's a harrowing story based on Greek mythology that was originally a Japanese manga series in the 90s. Not familiar with the ancient play Oedipus Rex that inspired these modern adaptations (I'll save you 104 minutes by telling you now: skip the 2013 version)? I won't spoil it for you because it makes the twist at the end of the movie much more shocking, but fair warning: this does not have a happy ending. Seen as one of the biggest films to spark the Korean wave in cinema, the movie is iconic in more ways than one. One scene that will forever stick with me is a fight sequence in a hallway that is reported to have taken multiple takes to get the flawless single shot it now is. The infamous scene is said to have inspired the fight choreography in many action films since, making Oldboy a piece of film history.\n\u2022 Watch Oldboyon Netflix now\n\u2022 Watch the Oldboy trailer\nHow we choose the best Netflix movies\nTo land a place on our list of best Netflix movies, each title doesn't have to be a huge hit on the world's best streaming service (i.e. one of the most-streamed movies in the platform's entire history). Instead, the movie needs to pass two tests: hold an 80% critics score on Rotten Tomatoes (RT) and be personally recommended by one of the members of the TechRadar streaming team.\nOur team of writers include Matthew Bolton, Amelia Schwanke, Tom Power, Lucy Buglass and Grace Morris, who all write and watch movies every day. We have varying views of what makes a good movie, which means our personal tastes cover a wide-range of genres and even sub-genres like psychological thrillers, action adventures, superhero spectacles, supernatural horrors and romantic dramas.\nTogether, we use this criteria and our cinephile expertise to help inform which films we pick to be the best Netflix movies. There are thousands of movies to stream on Netflix and this changes every month with new arrivals and removals, so this is by no means an exhaustive list. Instead, make sure to check back in with us every month to see which new entries we add.\nFor more Netflix coverage, read our best Netflix documentaries and best Netflix shows guides.
