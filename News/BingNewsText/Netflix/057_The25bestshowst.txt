    "maintext": "01 of 25\nA Killer Paradox (2024)\nWhat retail worker hasn\u2019t wanted to let loose on a rude customer? When meek loser Lee Tang (Choi Woo-shik) gives in to that impulse with a hammer, he\u2019s horrified\u2026 until he finds out he accidentally murdered a serial killer. Based on the award-winning webtoon of the same name, this stylish and fantastical Korean thriller follows Tang\u2019s progression into vigilante murder, with the dogged detective (Son Suk-ku) tracking his every kill.\nWhere to watch A Killer Paradox: Netflix\nCast: Choi Woo-shik, Son Suk-ku, Lee Hee-joon\n02 of 25\nAmerican Nightmare (2024)\nThe nightmare at the center of this true crime docuseries belongs first and foremost to Denise Huskins and Aaron Quinn, the home invasion victims who were unfairly accused of staging Huskins\u2019 kidnapping, rape, and return. The American nightmare, on the other hand, belongs to all of us. Watching the police hold a press conference to paint Huskins and Quinn as Gone Girl hucksters will infuriate you, especially when the media spreads the false narrative with glee.\nThe true crime genre is undergoing a reckoning lately, and rightly so, but this three-part examination of how institutions fail victims represents what the genre can do when filmmakers cover their topics with care and empathy.\nWhere to watch American Nightmare: Netflix\nCast: Denise Huskins, Aaron Quinn\n03 of 25\nBlue Eye Samurai (2023\u2013present)\nSet in 1600s Edo Japan, Blue Spirit Studios brings married showrunners Michael Green (Logan) and Amber Noizumi\u2019s dizzyingly violent vision to life, especially in the fight scenes. And there are A LOT of fight scenes in this gorgeous adult animation series. Our titular hero is Mizu (Maya Erskine), a blue-eyed mixed-race woman who disguises herself as a man to become a deadly fighter, even as her interracial identity makes her the target of vicious treatment.\nShe embarks on a journey to track down and kill the four white men left in her closed-border country, one of whom is her father. An all-star cast (Brenda Song, Randall Park, George Takei, Kenneth Branagh) bring their best to the series, but Masi Oka (Heroes) is a standout as Mizu\u2019s optimistic, would-be apprentice. The first eight episodes were so well-received, the show will return with a second season.\nWhere to watch Blue Eye Samurai: Netflix\nCast: Maya Erskine, Brenda Song, Randall Park, George Takei, Kenneth Branagh, Masi Oka\n04 of 25\nCall the Midwife (2012\u2013present)\nThe beloved British drama about young midwives in London kicked off in 1957 and currently takes place in 1969. That\u2019s 13 highly bingeable seasons of cheering on the young nurses (and the Anglican nuns who run Nonnatus House) as they provide vital healthcare services to the poverty-stricken East End.\nBased on Jenny Lee\u2019s memoirs, each season highlights England\u2019s rapidly changing culture through the lens of motherhood (birth control, self-managed abortion, sex work, intersex births, and more). What keeps you hooked on Call the Midwife, though, are the midwives whose lives are inevitably changed by the job.\nWhere to watch Call the Midwife: Netflix\nCast: Vanessa Redgrave, Jenny Agutter, Judy Parfitt, Helen George, Laura Main, Stephen McGann\n05 of 25\nCobra Kai (2018\u2013present)\nWe regret to inform you that it\u2019s been 40 YEARS since the original Karate Kid movie. The sequel series is no spring chicken either, as season 6 is set to (finally!) premiere this year with senseis Daniel LaRusso (Ralph Macchio) and Johnny Lawrence (William Zabka) preparing their students for the Sekai Taikai international karate tournament, where multiple old enemies are bound to complicate things.\nCobra Kai is the rare show that Gen X, millennials, and Gen Z can love equally. Season 6 continues on November 15th, so catch up now.\nWhere to watch Cobra Kai: Netflix\nCast: Ralph Macchio, William Zabka, Yuji Okumoto, Peyton List, Mary Mouser\n06 of 25\nCrashing (2016)\nBefore she was Fleabag, Phoebe Waller-Bridge wrote herself another absurdly messy lead role in this charming quick-binge comedy. Set in an abandoned hospital where twentysomethings live for cheap rent (a real thing in England), Crashing has Waller-Bridge\u2019s trademark cutting wit combined with an open, bleeding heart at the center of every joke. All that plus a pre-Bridgerton Jonathan Bailey with bleached blond hair!\nWhere to watch Crashing: Netflix\nCast: Phoebe Waller-Bridge, Jonathan Bailey, Julie Dray, Louise Ford\n07 of 25\nCunk on Earth (2022)\nTracing human history from the earliest civilizations to the space race, reporter Philomena Cunk (comedian Diane Morgan) is on a mission to reach \u201cevery corner of the globe money and pandemic travel restrictions would allow.\u201d The highlight of this five-episode mockumentary series is the dozens of real-life experts who patiently deal with Cunk\u2019s deadpan cluelessness, like British historian Martin Kemp answering the question, \"Which was more culturally significant: the Renaissance, or \u2018Single Ladies\u2019 by Beyonc\u00e9?\" with a seriousness that couldn\u2019t be funnier.\nWhere to watch Cunk on Earth: Netflix\nCast: Diane Morgan\n08 of 25\nDerry Girls (2018\u20132022)\nLisa McGee\u2019s semi-autobiographical series, about growing up in the titular Northern Ireland towns during the Troubles, could have been a sentimental coming-of-age dramedy. Luckily, she went in another direction. The Derry Girls are hilariously inept teenagers dealing with constant self-created mayhem. Add an Irish family, an obnoxious Pick-Me-Girl classmate (Leah O'Rourke), and the permanently over-it Catholic school headmistress (the perfectly dry Siobh\u00e1n McSweeney), and you have Derry Girls, an absolute corker of a show.\nWhere to watch Derry Girls: Netflix\nCast: Saoirse-Monica Jackson, Nicola Coughlan, Louisa Harland, Jamie-Lee O'Donnell, Dylan Llewellyn, Siobh\u00e1n McSweeney\n09 of 25\nThe Diplomat (2023\u2013present)\nYou can hear creator Debora Cahn\u2019s West Wing writing roots in the rat-a-tat dialogue of The Diplomat. (This is a compliment.) Keri Russell, allowed to be slightly lighthearted for once, plays Kate Wyler, the new and reluctant U.S. ambassador to the U.K.\nEverything would be fine if not for her on-again, off-again Machiavellian spouse (a rakish Rufus Sewell) who loves to scheme in her best interest, a staff who keep trying to put her in designer dresses, a too-hot guy who works for British intelligence (David Gyasi), and an international incident that could lead to World War III. Fun political dramedy is hard to come by, and this one nails it. Season 2 is out as of Oct. 31, so enjoy!\nWhere to watch The Diplomat: Netflix\nEW grade: A\u2013 (read the review)\nCast: Keri Russell, Rufus Sewell, David Gyasi\n10 of 25\nDocumentary Now! (2015\u20132022)\nLike a much funnier version of the Traveling Wilburys, SNL alumni Bill Hader, Fred Armisen, Seth Meyers, and Rhys Thomas formed a comedy supergroup in 2015 to lovingly parody acclaimed documentaries.\nEach standalone episode mimics a work\u2019s filming style, subjects, and storyline \u2014 but with a twist. When We Were Kings, about the infamous Muhammad Ali/George Foreman \u201cRumble in the Jungle\u201d fight, becomes How They Threw Rocks, about a fictional Welsh sport that\u2019s essentially dodgeball with stones. The only thing every entry has in common is an introduction from host Dame Helen Mirren, playing her role with a gravitas that dares you to laugh (and you will).\nWhere to watch Documentary Now!: Netflix\nEW grade: A\u2013 (read the review)\nCast: Bill Hader, Fred Armisen, Seth Meyers, Rhys Thomas, Helen Mirren\n11 of 25\nFeel Good (2020\u20132021)\nIf you only know Mae Martin from their comedy specials or the Handsome podcast with Tig Notaro and Fortune Feimster, now is the time to watch their underseen rom-com series. The semi-autobiographical show follows Martin falling in love with shy teacher George (Charlotte Ritchie), but their romance is complicated by addiction, past trauma, late-in-life coming out, and family.\nThough the subject matter is serious, the execution is wry, especially when Martin\u2019s mother Linda (Lisa Kudrow, sharply hilarious) chimes in.\nWhere to watch Feel Good: Netflix\nCast: Mae Martin, Charlotte Ritchie, Lisa Kudrow\n12 of 25\nFriday Night Lights (2006\u20132011)\nIf Friday Night Lights was just about Coach and Mrs. Coach (Kyle Chandler and Connie Britton, respectively) having one of the best marriages in television history, the series might have still made this list. But luckily, the Emmy-winning drama about high school football in a small-town Texas has plenty of other attributes.\nIt\u2019s hard not to fall in love with just about every character, especially those played by the young and stellar cast (Zach Gilford, Minka Kelly, Adrianne Palicki, Taylor Kitsch, Jesse Plemons, Jurnee Smollett, Matt Lauria, and Michael B. Jordan, just to name a few!). Clear eyes and full hearts, y\u2019all.\nWhere to watch Friday Night Lights: Netflix\nCast: Kyle Chandler, Connie Britton, Zach Gilford, Minka Kelly, Adrianne Palicki, Taylor Kitsch, Jesse Plemons, Jurnee Smollett, Matt Lauria, Michael B. Jordan\n13 of 25\nThe Gentlemen (2024\u2013present)\nGuy Ritchie created this action series as a spin-off of his 2019 movie, but it works just fine on its own. When Amy Capt. Edward Horniman (Theo James) unexpectedly inherits his father\u2019s estate and title, he doesn\u2019t expect to also inherit the drug operation on his land run by an incarcerated drug kingpin (Ray Winstone) and his daughter (Kaya Scodelario). Add to the mix a nefarious American billionaire (Giancarlo Esposito), an entire Liverpool crime organization, and Eddie\u2019s messy screwup of a brother Freddy (Daniel Ings), and you\u2019ve got a binge with plenty of high-octane hijinks \u2014 and a new season on the way.\nWhere to watch The Gentlemen: Netflix\nCast: Theo James, Ray Winstone, Kaya Scodelario, Giancarlo Esposito, Daniel Ings, Freddie Fox\n14 of 25\nGLOW (2017\u20132019)\nIf you weren\u2019t watching local syndicated television in the 1980s, you might have missed the real-life Gorgeous Ladies of Wrestling variety show. Have no fear, the fictionalized version is just a binge away. Sports fan and would-be producer Bash (Chris Lowell) funds a women\u2019s wrestling program directed by a washed-up has-been (Marc Maron at his weary best) and starring the oddballs willing to take on the physically and mentally grueling job.\nRuth (Alison Brie) and Debbie (Betty Gilpin) anchor the cast as the Cold War heel-and-hero combination Zoya the Destroya and Liberty Belle, who slowly realize they could run the show themselves. Even though GLOW was unfairly canceled too soon, there\u2019s still plenty to love about this three-season gem.\nWhere to watch GLOW: Netflix\nCast: Alison Brie, Betty Gilpin, Marc Maron, Chris Lowell, Kate Nash\n15 of 25\nGirls5eva (2021\u2013present)\nNetflix rescued this Tina Fey-produced musical comedy \u2014 about a \u201890s one-hit wonder group that stages a comeback \u2014 from Peacock. And thank goodness, because season 3 has put the band back on the road for more ridiculous adventures.\nEach of the four women brings their own set of hilarious neurosis: Dawn (Sara Bareilles), the songwriter balancing her dreams and family life; Summer (Busy Philipps), who navigates divorce and independence; Gloria (Paula Pell), the lesbian dentist who relishes being creative again; and Wickie (Renee Elise Goldsberry) the diva determined to make it. Every song is a banger, the jokes are rapid-fire, and 4eva is definitely too short.\nWhere to watch Girls5eva: Netflix\nCast: Sara Bareilles, Renee Elise Goldsberry, Busy Philipps, Paula Pell\n16 of 25\nThe Harlan Coben Collection (2020\u20132024)\nHarlan Coben, your dad\u2019s favorite mystery-thriller author, writes clever, fast-paced, plot-driven books that make for a great limited series. Netflix went wisely international in its adaptations, so these eight standalone productions shot in France, Poland, England, and Spain make for visually beautiful storytelling.\nStarring actors you may already know (Cush Jumbo, Richard Armitage, and Michael C. Hall) as well as international stand-outs you\u2019ll wish you\u2019d known sooner (Mario Casas, Grzegorz Dami\u0119cki, and Magdalena Boczarska), these titles are great when you need a whodunit.\nWhere to watch The Harlan Coben Collection: Netflix\nCast: Cush Jumbo, Richard Armitage, Michael C. Hall, Mario Casas, Grzegorz Dami\u0119cki, Magdalena Boczarska\n17 of 25\nInsecure (2016\u20132021)\nHBO has begun licensing content to Netflix, so there\u2019s no better time to start binging shows you might have missed. Start with this Emmy-nominated comedy-drama about two best friends: Issa (Issa Rae), the unfocused non-profit worker stuck in a stale relationship who raps encouragement to herself in the mirror, and Molly (Yvonne Orji), the driven lawyer with sky-high dating standards.\nDeftly balancing the ridiculous (every instance of Issa\u2019s white boss at the non-profit We Got Y\u2019all) with the authentic (Issa and Molly\u2019s rocky friendship, which dominates a stellar season 4), Insecure is about growing up when you\u2019re already grown.\nWhere to watch Insecure: Netflix\nCast: Issa Rae, Yvonne Orji, Lisa Joyce, Natasha Rothwell, Jay Ellis\n18 of 25\nNever Have I Ever (2020\u20132023)\nJohn McEnroe\u2019s brattiest days are far behind him, but he\u2019s still the perfect narrator for how 15-year-old Devi Vishwakumar (newcomer Maitreyi Ramakrishnan) feels when her father suddenly dies while watching her band recital. Dealing with grief that leaves her angry and impulsive, Devi struggles to connect with her mother (Poorna Jagannathan), her best friends (Ramona Young and Lee Rodriguez), and her academic rival/potential suitor (Jaren Lewison).\nSeries co-creator Mindy Kaling balances the coming-of-age comedy and drama almost as perfectly as McEnroe breathes the words \u201cPaxton Hall-Yoshida!\u201d every time Devi sees her not-so-out-of-reach crush (Darren Barnet).\nWhere to watch Never Have I Ever: Netflix\nEW grade: A\u2013 (read the review)\nCast: Maitreyi Ramakrishnan, Poorna Jagannathan, Ramona Young, Lee Rodriguez, Jaren Lewison, Darren Barnet, John McEnroe\n19 of 25\nOne Day (2024)\nIt\u2019s a tale as old as time: A working-class girl meets an upper-crust boy, there\u2019s a will-they-or-won\u2019t-they tension, and they reunite once a year for two decades. Based on the 2009 David Nicholls novel and one-upping the lackluster 2011 Anne Hathaway movie, this series has three major advantages over previous incarnations: Leo Woodall as Dexter, Ambika Mod as Emma, and the undeniable chemistry between them. It\u2019s a love story that will probably make you cry, but it\u2019s one you won\u2019t regret watching.\nWhere to watch One Day: Netflix\nCast: Leo Woodall, Ambika Mod, Eleanor Tomlinson, Essie Davis, Tim McInnerny\n20 of 25\nPeaky Blinders (2013\u20132022)\nPeaky Blinders is a highly stylized, ultra-violent, fun-as-a-fixed-horse race family crime drama. World War I veteran Tommy Shelby (newly minted Oscar-winner Cillian Murphy) fights to run the successful Birmingham gang while also keeping control of his hotheaded Aunt Polly (the late, great Helen McCrory), his hotheaded brother Arthur (Paul Anderson), his hotheaded little sister Ada (Sophie Rundle), and various other hotheads who make his days difficult.\nEarly in season 1, he meets and falls madly in love with Grace (Annabelle Wallis), who may or may not be his downfall. Once you finish your binge, you can look forward to the upcoming movie that will wrap up Tommy\u2019s story.\nWhere to watch Peaky Blinders: Netflix\nCast: Cillian Murphy, Sam Neill, Helen McCrory, Paul Anderson, Sophie Rundle, Finn Cole, Joe Cole, Tom Hardy, Anya Taylor-Joy\n21 of 25\nResident Alien (2021\u2013present)\nAlan Tudyk leads this series as Dr. Harry Vanderspeigle, an extraterrestrial sent to destroy the human race but who instead decides to assimilate into society as the medical examiner of a small, Colorado town. Throughout three seasons (so far), Harry deals with alien hunters, other aliens, meddling kids (he could have gotten away with it, too!) and, of course, falling in love. Not to mention pretending to be a person isn\u2019t as easy as Law & Order made it look.\nWhere to watch Resident Alien: Netflix\nCast: Alan Tudyk, Sara Tomko, Corey Reynolds, Alice Wetterlund, Levi Fiehler, Judah Prehn, Elizabeth Bowen\n22 of 25\nSix Feet Under (2001\u20132005)\nSure, this Alan Ball HBO drama has one the greatest series finales of all time, but before you get there, you\u2019ve got 62 other episodes that are also pretty stellar. The ensemble centers around the Fisher family (Peter Krause, Michael C. Hall, Lauren Ambrose, and Frances Conroy) who run a funeral home in Los Angeles after the sudden loss of their patriarch, exploring death as a constant companion both literally and figuratively.\nEach episode begins with the demise of someone who ends up in the Fisher home \u2014 some tragic (a child dies of SIDS), some darkly comedic (a cube of airplane waste drops from the sky and lands on a woman), and all reminding the Fishers that the end is just around the corner.\nWhere to watch Six Feet Under: Netflix\nEW grade: B+ (read the review)\nCast: Peter Krause, Michael C. Hall, Frances Conroy, Lauren Ambrose, Freddy Rodriguez, Mathew St. Patrick, Jeremy Sisto, Rachel Griffiths, James Cromwell, Justina Machado\n23 of 25\nStateless (2020)\nThis intense Australian limited series highlights the troubled history of the country\u2019s many detention centers for undocumented immigrants. Created by Cate Blanchett, who plays a small role as a conniving self-help con artist, we follow four stories: Sofie (Yvonne Strahovski), who ended up in detention while trying to escape a cult; Ameer (Fayssal Bazzi), a single-father refugee who flees Afghanistan; Clare (Asher Keddie), an administrator in over her head; and Cam (Jai Courtney), a new officer who\u2019s only in it for the solid paycheck. It\u2019s a harrowing watch, all the more so when you find out it's based on a true story.\nWhere to watch Stateless: Netflix\nEW grade: A\u2013 (read the review here)\nCast: Yvonne Strahovski, Cate Blanchett, Fayssal Bazzi, Asher Keddie, Jai Courtney, Dominic West\n24 of 25\nSuits (2011\u20132019)\nIf you haven\u2019t already joined the most popular binge-watch of the last year, what are you waiting for? Part of the Blue Sky era on the USA Network, this fun legal drama tells the story of Mike Ross (Patrick J. Adams), a brilliant college dropout with a photographic memory who\u2019s hired as an associate by successful corporate attorney Harvey Specter (Gabriel Macht). Together, they win cases, charm clients, and hide Mike\u2019s secret \u2014 something that gets more and more difficult over nine seasons.\nThe terrific supporting cast includes true royalty (Meghan Markle, literally the Duchess of Sussex; Gina Torres, the queen of whatever screen she\u2019s on; and Rick Hoffman, the king of my heart), who all make the most of their characters.\nWhere to watch Suits: Netflix\nCast: Gabriel Macht, Patrick J. Adams, Rick Hoffman, Meghan Markle, Sarah Rafferty, Gina Torres\n25 of 25\nThe Tourist (2022\u2013present)\nJamie Dornan stars in this BBC mystery as a man who wakes up in an Australian hospital with no memory of what the audience has already seen: that his car was chased down and purposely hit by a semi-truck. Across two tense seasons, the amnesiac tries to figure out who he is and what happened with the help of sweet Probationary Constable Helen Chambers (a delightful Danielle Macdonald) and Luci, a waitress who knows more than she\u2019s letting on (Shalom Brune-Franklin). But the more he finds out about his past, the less he wants to remember.\nWhere to watch The Tourist: Netflix\nCast: Jamie Dornan, Danielle Macdonald, Shalom Brune-Franklin, \u00d3lafur Darri \u00d3lafsson, Genevieve Lemon, Alex Dimitriades, Damon Herriman",
