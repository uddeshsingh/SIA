    "maintext": "For once, the top 10 movies on iTunes and Fandango aren\u2019t close to a mirror image of each other. \u201cConclave\u201d (Focus) and \u201cTerrifier 3\u201d (Cineverse), both successful October releases that exceeded theatrical expectations, were released on PVOD last week. They had the same availability ($19.99 for 48 hour rental, $24.99 to digitally download) yet vastly different results.\nEdward Berger\u2019s top award-contending \u201cConclave\u201d took an immediate top spot at iTunes from its first day, yet is only #8 for the full-week in the Fandango top 10. Damien Leone\u2019s \u201cTerrifier 3\u201d leads at Fandango, yet only briefly appeared during the week at iTunes (debuting at #3) before dropping off the list. It currently ranks #14.\nThe two charts can vary, but mainly in cases of different pricing. Fandango ranks by revenue accrued for a title, while iTunes goes by transactions. But in this case, they are the same price, making the different placements quite odd. In terms of relative position using daily charts for the week, \u201cTerrifier 3\u201d looks like it would have placed #8 there on a seven day list.\nNetflix, after two beefcake Christmas originals (\u201cHot Frosty\u201d then \u201cThe Merry Gentlemen\u201d) at #1 on its domestic movie top 10, continues the holiday theme with \u201cOur Little Secret.\u201d This one stars Lindsay Lohan (who has a production deal with the streamer) and Ian Harding as a former couple unexpectedly spending the holiday together when it turns out they are currently dating each others\u2019 siblings.\n\u201cElevation\u201d (Vertical), a thriller with Anthony Mackie, also debuted on both charts. It took third place at Fandango, unexpectedly much higher than \u201cConclave.\u201d It is #8 at iTunes. Also new, but only at Fandango, is \u201cDear Santa\u201d (Paramount) starring Jack Black. It\u2019s fourth there, but only #27 at iTunes (it can be bought for $14.99). Made for Paramount+, it was released initially on PVOD.\n\u201cSanta\u201d shares with \u201cSecret\u201d a pedigree in its director. Lindsay Lohan\u2019s film is directed by Stephen Herek, whose credits include \u201cBill and Ted\u2019s Excellent Adventure,\u201d \u201cThe Mighty Ducks,\u201d \u201cMr. Holland\u2019s Opus,\u201d and the live action \u201c101 Dalmations.\u201d Bobby Farrelly, of the Farrelly Brothers (\u201cThere\u2019s Something About Mary,\u201d \u201cDumb and Dumber,\u201d \u201cMe Myself and Irene\u201d) directed \u201cSanta.\u201d Both have had storied careers, but the kinds of hits they made are no longer on the frontburner of theatrical production.\nThis week\u2019s VOD charts feature several films in top positions because of newly reduced rental prices. \u201cThe Substance\u201d (MUBI), now #3 at iTunes, \u201cBeetlejuice Beetlejuice\u201d (Warner Bros.) #2 at Fandango, rare for a $5.99 price film there, \u201cDeadpool & Wolverine\u201d (Disney) all were elevated. The perennial \u201cHow the Grinch Stole Christmas\u201d (Universal) is #2 at iTunes, ninth at Fandango.\nThough three other originals are on Netflix\u2019s top 10 (including #2 \u201cSpellbound,\u201d which was first for a day during the week, and just released \u201cThe Snow Sister\u201d from Norway #10), their acclaimed \u201cThe Piano Lesson\u201d dropped off after only one week, getting no higher than #5. A number of new studio library titles were added, with \u201cFast\u201d starring the ubiquitous Dwayne Johnson (the 2010 film is not part of the \u201cFast and Furious\u201d franchise) #2 at the moment.\nTop 10s\niTunes ranks films daily by number of transactions, while Fandango at Home lists by revenue.
