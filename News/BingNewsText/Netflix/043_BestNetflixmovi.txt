High-octane action comedy Baby Driver will certainly deliver on that wish. Edgar Wright\u2019s Baby Driver follows getaway driver Baby (Ansel Elgort) who uses his iPod playlists to drown out his tinnitus, which cleverly provides the killer soundtrack to his car chases. While Baby wants to escape his life of crime, he is forced into taking on one more job from criminal mastermind Doc (Kevin Spacey), which swiftly takes a turn for the worst. Baby Driver sounds as good as it looks (it won the Empire Award for Best Soundtrack in 2018) with exhilarating pursuits, gravity-defying stunts, action-packed twists and heartwarming romance that will have you clinging onto your car dashboard.\n\u2022 Watch Baby Driver on Netflix now\n\u2022 Watch Baby Driver's trailer on YouTube\nTop Gun: Maverick\nAge rating: 12\nRuntime: 131 minutes\nMain cast: Tom Cruise, Miles Teller, Jennifer Connolly, Jon Hamm, Glen Powell, and Val Kilmer\nDirector: Joseph Kosinski\nRT score: 96%\nRecommended by\nRecommended by\nAxel Metz\nOne of 2022\u2019s best movies, Top Gun: Maverick is a near-perfect example of how to deliver a long overdue sequel to a 1980s cult classic film. Action star Tom Cruise reprises his role as Peter \u2018Maverick\u2019 Mitchell from 1986\u2019s Top Gun, with the experienced pilot forced to confront his past while training a new generation of aviators for a dangerous mission in enemy territory. In my Top Gun: Maverick review, I called the dormant franchise\u2019s latest entry a \u201cjaw-dropping spectacle\u201d and \u201cbona fide blockbuster\u201d that\u2019s \u201csuperior to its predecessor in almost every conceivable way\u201d.

However, when a new drug gives powers to ordinary people, two cops join forces with two ex-superheroes to stop a dark organisation trafficking superpowers. How I Became a Super Hero is a refreshing change of pace from Marvel and DC blockbusters and focuses more on plot than action, with a realistic yet intriguing take on how super powers would impact society. Hopefully there will be a sequel so we can explore this new world more!\n\u2022 Watch How I Became a Super Hero on Netflix now\n\u2022 Watch How I Became a Super Hero's trailer on YouTube\nAll Quiet on the Western Front\nAge rating: 15\nRuntime: 148 minutes\nMain cast: Felix Kammerer, Albrecht Schuch, Aaron Hilmer, and Moritz Klaus\nDirector: Edward Berger\nRT score: 90%\nRecommended by\nRecommended by\nTom Power\nIt\u2019s been a good few years since Dunkirk and 1917 reminded audiences of the horrors of war, but Netflix assumed that responsibility with shocking but beautifully-made WWI epic All Quiet on the Western Front. Based on Erich Maria Remarque\u2019s landmark novel of the same name (which was first adapted into a feature film in 1930), this German-language movie tells the story of a young German soldier (Felix Kammerer) whose na\u00efve expectations of fighting for his country are shattered by war\u2019s harrowing reality. As you'd expect, All Quiet on the Western Front is brutal, vivid, and poignant \u2013 just don\u2019t expect to reach its credits feeling particularly joyous.\n\u2022 Watch All Quiet on the Western Front on Netflix now\n\u2022 Watch All Quiet on the Western Front's trailer on YouTube\nBest animated movies on Netflix\nApollo 10 1/2: A Space Age Childhood\nAge rating: 12\nRuntime: 98 minutes\nMain cast: Jack Black, Bill Wise, Lee Eddy, Milo Coy, Zachary Levi, and Glen Powell\nDirector: Richard Linklater\nRT score: 91%\nRecommended by\nRecommended by\nTom Power\nIf you\u2019re keen to mix up your movie-watching diet, films don't come more unconventional than Apollo 10 1/2: A Space Age Childhood. Linklater's (Boyhood) 2022 animated feature, which tells the story of the 1969 moon landing from multiple perspectives, is a sweet and nostalgic visual feast for the eyes that'll hug at the heartstrings of anyone who's dreamed of heading to space. Apollo 10 1/2 shares the visual style of Linklater\u2019s previous animation \u2013 2006's A Scanner Darkly \u2013 and features The Super Mario Bros. Movie's Jack Black, Shazam! Fury of the Gods' Zachary Levi, and Top Gun: Maverick star Glen Powell in various voice acting roles. Long title notwithstanding, it's a fascinating and visually bold take on one of history\u2019s most iconic moments.

It's perfect for those who love folklore as it's packed with popular creatures like selkies and plenty of gorgeous visuals throughout. It also has a lot of depth, and we're not just talking about the ocean. There's plenty of emotion here, and it's one of the most beautiful explorations of loss I've ever seen. A must watch.\nWatch Song of the Sea on Netflix now\nWatch Song of the Sea's trailer on YouTube\nGuillermo del Toro's Pinocchio\nAge rating: PG\nRuntime: 121 minutes\nMain cast: Gregory Mann, Ewan McGregor, David Bradley, Tilda Swinton, Cate Blanchett, and Finn Holfhard\nDirectors: Guillermo del Toro and Mark Gustafson\nRT score: 96%\nRecommended by\nRecommended by\nTom Power\nGuillermo del Toro\u2019s Pinocchio breathed new life into Carlo Collodi's beloved 1883 fairytale \u2013 about a wooden puppet who longs to become a real boy \u2013 when it debuted on the platform in late 2022. Shot entirely using stop-motion (in a manner akin to Netflix series The House), del Toro\u2019s darker adaptation is set in 1930s Italy during Mussolini\u2019s fascist regime and features a star-studded voice cast who bring vivacity, levity, menace, and more to each of the films' distinct characters. Easily one of the best Netflix movies of recent times, animated or otherwise \u2013 and its multiple trophy wins on the 2023 awards circuit proved it.\n\u2022 Watch Guillermo del Toro's Pinocchio on Netflix now\n\u2022 Watch Guillermo del Toro's Pinocchio's trailer on YouTube\nThe Mitchells vs the Machines\nAge rating: U\nRuntime: 114 minutes\nMain cast: Abbi Jacobson, Danny McBride, Maya Rudolph, Michael Rianda, and Olivia Colman\nDirector: Michael Rianda\nRT score: 97%\nRecommended by\nRecommended by\nTom Power\nIn The Mitchells vs The Machines, Jacobson voices Katie Mitchell, an aspiring director who's set to leave home for college \u2013 until her dad, conscious that they're not as close as they used to be, cancels her plane ticket and decides to travel across the country with Abbi for one final family road-trip. Midway through said journey, an AI seeks retribution on its billionaire creator and the world is suddenly thrown into disarray by a robot uprising. Plenty of Spider-Verse's visual touches are evident in this one, with 2D annotations and drawings on the already-pretty 3D visuals. A beautiful film in more ways than one and fully deserving of its spot on both this list and best Netflix family movies list.\n\u2022 Watch The Mitchells vs The Machines on Netflix now\n\u2022 Watch The Mitchells vs the Machines' trailer on YouTube\nNimona\nAge rating: PG\nRuntime: 102 minutes\nMain cast: Chloe Grace Moretz, Riz Ahmed, Eugene Lee Yang, and Frances Conroy\nDirectors: Nick Bruno and Troy Quane\nRT score: 92%\nRecommended by\nRecommended by\nTom Power\nBased on ND Stevenson's 2015 graphic novel of the same name, Nimona is a delightfully fun, action-packed, funny, and heartwarming flick that's also unapologetically queer. Ahmed (Star Wars: Rogue One) stars as Ballister Blackheart, a knight of a futurism-inspired realm who's framed for the murder of his kingdom's queen. The only individual who can get him out of a tight spot is Nimona (The Peipheral's Chloe Grace Moretz), a shapeshifter who the realm's knights are sworn to keep their citizens safe from. Cue an extraordinarily fun buddy cop-style tale that teaches kids to accept people for who they are. With its authentic LGBTQ+ representation, subversive storytelling, and creative animation style, among many other positives, Nimona is a worthy inclusion in our best Netflix movies guide.\n\u2022 Watch Nimona on Netflix now\n\u2022 Watch Nimona's trailer on YouTube\nPaddington 1 and 2\nAge rating: PG\nRuntime: 95 minutes (Paddington 1); 103 minutes (Paddington 2)\nMain cast: Ben Whishaw, Hugh Bonneville, Sally Hawkins, Madeleine Harris, and Samuel Joslin\nDirector: Paul King\nRT score: 97% (Paddington 1); 99% (Paddington 2)\nRecommended by\nRecommended by\nTom Power\nNot that it needed saying, but Paddington and its sequel \u2013 Paddington 2 \u2013 are some of the best family movies ever made. And no, I won't be explaining why, because it's pretty much self-explanatory. On the surface, the world-renowned marmalade sandwich-eating Peruvian bear didn't seem like the kind of character to lead a universally adored duology. As it happens, however, Paddington (voiced with a deftness, warmth, and stacks of humor by Whishaw) is an unassuming but fantastic movie star, with his two big-screen adventures proving as much. You'll cry laughing at their slapstick moments, cry some more at its heart-wrenching (and heart-warming!) scenes, and do your best Leonardo Di Caprio pointing meme impersonation whenever a big-name star shows up.

Charming, action-packed, and beautifully-rendered, The Sea Beast has been a mainstay of this guide for a long time. Not only that, but it also showed that Netflix needed to think twice about scaling back its animation department upon the film's arrival. Judging by the great animated movies we've received since, it's done just that, too.\n\u2022 Watch The Sea Beast on Netflix now\n\u2022 Watch The Sea Beast's trailer on YouTube\nSpirited Away\nAge rating: PG\nRuntime: 125 minutes\nMain cast: Daveigh Chase, Suzanne Pleshette, Jason Marsden, and Susan Egan\nDirector: Hayao Miyazaki\nRT score: 96%\nRecommended by\nRecommended by\nTom Power\nLegendary filmmaker Hayao Miyazaki and his award-winning animation company Studio Ghibli are pretty much unmatched when it comes to gorgeous, 2D-style kid-friendly flicks. They're all beautifully animated and most are deeply moving, with plenty of rich, deep themes and subject matter than you'd expect from movies aimed squarely at your children. Nearly all of Ghibli's films are available on Netflix, but it's Spirited Away that's arguably the studio's most famous and popular work of art (sorry, My Neighbor Totoro fans). Without giving too much away: the best anime is about a girl named Chihiro whose parents are turned into pigs (yes, really) who then goes to work in a mystical bathhouse.

After discovering a once-in-a-lifetime player with a rocky past abroad, Stanley Sugerman (Sandler), a down-on-his-luck Philadelphia 76ers scout, takes it upon himself to bring the young phenom to the States without his team's approval. Against the odds, the pair must work to prove that they both deserve to make it big in the NBA. That synopsis might sound like standard sports drama fare, but Hustle earned unexpectedly glowing reviews ahead of its muted release. Trust us: this is no Jack and Jill.\n\u2022 Watch Hustle on Netflix now\n\u2022 Watch Hustle's trailer on YouTube\nMatilda the Musical\nAge rating: PG\nRuntime: 122 minutes\nMain cast: Emma Thompson, Alisha Weir, Lashana Lynch, and Stephen Graham\nDirector: Matthew Warchus\nRT score: 93%\nRecommended by\nRecommended by\nTom Power\nHeavily inspired by the successful stage musical of the same name \u2013 which itself is influenced by Roald Dahl's classic novel \u2013 Matilda the Musical is a delightful sing-a-long comedy-drama that's fun for the whole family. Weir portrays the titular character who, as a response to her horrendous upbringing, develops telekinetic abilities. Armed with powers that can help people (and mischievously get back at those who have wronged her), Matilda puts her abilities to good and humorous use, such as taking on the wicked Crunchem Hall School headmaster Miss Trunchbull (Thompson). A superb reimagining of a beloved story whose soundtrack will live in your head for days.\n\u2022 Watch Matilda the Musical on Netflix now\n\u2022 Watch Matilda the Musical's trailer on YouTube\nBest drama movies on Netflix\nThe Irishman\nAge rating:15\nRuntime: 209 minutes\nMain cast: Robert De Niro, Joe Pesci, Al Pacino, and Anna Paquin\nDirector: Martin Scorsese\nRT score: 95%\nRecommended by\nRecommended by\nTom Power\nThis threateningly long Scorsese pic attracted attention for the extensive effects work used to de-age its old stars, and it's a creative decision that's sometimes distracting. But there's no denying the appeal of seeing Robert De Niro, Joe Pesci, and Al Pacino in the same movie together for likely the last time, and this life-spanning, mostly rewarding crime epic is a suitable tribute to their collective talents. The Irishman follows Frank Sheeran (De Niro) as he recounts his long association with the Bufalino crime family and infamous union leader Jimmy Hoffa (Pacino). It's a languid film \u2013 and not a patch on Goodfellas \u2013 but absolutely among the best Netflix movies the streaming service has financed to date. You can see how The Irishman ranked on our best Martin Scorsese movies list.\n\u2022 Watch The Irishman on Netflix now\n\u2022 Watch The Irishman's trailer on YouTube\nUncut Gems\nAge rating: 15\nRuntime: 135 minutes\nMain cast: Adam Sandler, LaKeith Stanfield, Julia Fox, and Kevin Garnett\nDirectors: Benny and Josh Safdie\nRT score: 91%\nRecommended by\nRecommended by\nTom Power\nThis sweaty-palmed thriller tells the frenetic tale of Howard Ratner (Sandler), a jeweller and gambler who plans a gem sale that'll solve all his problems. Instead, Howard makes more and more ill-advised bets, and the walls begin to close in. Uncut Gems is a stressful but enthralling film with a really impressive performance from Sandler, not to mention a fantastic ensemble cast. It's a fascinating character study, as you watch Ratner begin to suffocate under the weight of his terrible decisions and inability to put anyone but himself first. A seriously underrated film.\n\u2022 Watch Uncut Gems on Netflix now\n\u2022 Watch Uncut Gems' trailer on YouTube\nThe Hand of God\nAge rating: 15\nRuntime: 130 minutes\nMain cast: Filippo Scotti, Tony Servillo, Teresa Sapoangelo, and Marlon Joubert\nDirector: Paolo Sorrentino\nRT score: 83%\nRecommended by\nRecommended by\nTom Power\nThe Hand of God marks the movie-making return of beloved Italian director Paolo Sorrentino, and tells the semi-autobiographical tale of a young man (Filippo Scotti, standing in for a teenage Sorrentino) grappling with the pressures of growing up in 1980s Naples. As well as referring to the infamous goal scored by Argentine footballer (and Napoli legend) Diego Maradona at the 1986 World Cup, the film's title alludes to a tragic and life-affirming event that forces its protagonist to grow up quicker than he'd otherwise like. To say more risks spoiling The Hand of God's most tender moments, though the movie's beautiful locations, hypnotic camerawork, and larger-than-life characters ensure it ranks among Sorrentino's best work.\n\u2022 Watch The Hand of God on Netflix now\n\u2022 Watch The Hand of God's trailer on YouTube\nRoma\nAge rating: 15\nRuntime: 134 minutes\nMain cast: Yalitza Aparicio, Marina de Tavira, Marco Graf, Fernando Grediaga, and Daniela Demesa\nDirector: Alfonso Cuaron\nRT score: 96%\nRecommended by\nRecommended by\nTom Power\nAn astonishing ode to motherhood in all forms, Roma is the most personal film to date from visionary director Alfonso Cuar\u00f3n (Children of Men, Gravity). On paper, it's is not the easiest sell \u2013 a subtitled black and white film about a live-in housekeeper spoken almost entirely in Spanish and the indigenous Mixtec language. But Cuar\u00f3n's 2018 critical hit is nonetheless riveting from a cinematic standpoint. More a series of vignettes than a traditional three-act story, it examines the life of a Mexico City family in the early 1970s during a time of great social upheaval.\n\u2022 Watch Roma on Netflix now\n\u2022 Watch Roma's trailer on YouTube\nSociety of the Snow\nAge rating: 15\nRuntime: 145 minutes\nMain cast: Enzo Vogrincic, Augustin Padella, Esteban Bigliardi, and Simon Hempe\nDirector: J.A. Bayona\nRT score: 90%\nRecommended by\nRecommended by\nTom Power\nJ.A. Bayona\u2019s latest flick \u2013 based on real-life events \u2013 is a harrowing portrayal of human endurance and how our primal survival instincts assume dominance over our humanity. Society of the Snow tells the tragic story of the 1972 Andes Air Disaster, which saw a Uruguayan rugby team crash-land in the freezing South American mountain range en route to a Chile-based tournament. Trapped in one of the most inhospitable places on Earth, the 16 survivors are forced to take extreme measures in order to stay alive. A heart-breaking and grim tale of human morality, but one that equally shines an earnest, powerful light on surviving against all odds. One of the best Netflix movies, from a foreign language perspective, you\u2019ll see.\n\u2022 Watch Society of the Snow on Netflix now\n\u2022 Watch Society of the Snow's trailer on YouTube\nThe Two Popes\nAge rating: 12\nRuntime: 125 minutes\nMain cast: Jonathan Pryce, Anthony Hopkins, and Sidney Cole\nDirector: Fernando Meirelles\nRT score: 89%\nRecommended by\nRecommended by\nTom Power\nAs soon as Pope Francis was elected head of the Catholic Church in 2013, people started asking when Jonathan Pryce \u2013 who shares a remarkable likeness with the Pontiff \u2013 might play him on screen. Netflix eventually made it come to pass, as City of God and The Constant Gardener director Fernando Meirelles took a peek through the keyholes of the Vatican. We\u2019ll never know how accurate the portrayal of Francis's meetings with Benedict XVI \u2013 his more conservative predecessor (played by Anthony Hopkins) \u2013 really are, but The Two Popes is a brilliant odd couple drama, especially when the duo let their hair down to watch their teams face off in the 2014 World Cup final.\n\u2022 Watch The Two Popes on Netflix now\n\u2022 Watch The Two Popes' trailer on YouTube\nThe Wonder\nAge rating: 15\nRuntime: 109 minutes\nMain cast: Florence Pugh, Tom Burke, Niamh Algar, and Elaine Cassidy\nDirector: Sebastien Lelio\nRT score: 85%\nRecommended by\nRecommended by\nTom Power\nPugh (Black Widow, Dune Part 2) proved her generational talent yet again in Netflix's unsettling drama-cum-horror The Wonder. Set in the Irish Midlands in 1862, the movie stars Pugh as an English nurse called to observe a young girl (K\u00edla Lord Cassidy) who remains miraculously alive and well despite not having eaten for four months. Ciar\u00e1n Hinds, Niamh Algar, and Toby Jones also star in Sebasti\u00e1n Lelio\u2019s period mystery. As period dramas go, The Wonder is an absorbing and fantastic flick that confirms Pugh's ability to embody every role she plays.\n\u2022 Watch The Wonder on Netflix now\n\u2022 Watch The Wonder' trailer on YouTube\nBeasts of No Nation\nAge rating: 15\nRuntime: 137 minutes\nMain cast: Idris Elba, Abraham Atta, and Kurt Egyiawan\nDirector: Cary Fukunaga\nRT score: 91%\nRecommended by\nRecommended by\nTom Power\nWe won't beat about the bush \u2013 Beasts of No Nation is a tough watch. No Time to Die's Cary Fukunaga directs this harrowing feature, which follows the journey of a young orphan (Abraham Attah) forced into becoming a child soldier by a fierce warlord (Idris Elba) during an unnamed African civil war. An adaptation of Uzodinma Iweala's novel of the same name, Beasts of No Nation is a masterfully-shot story documenting the human cost of conflict, and places the uncomfortable realities of war front and centre. This isn't one to watch with the kids, but sitting through its two-hour narrative is an enlightening, dare-we-say necessary movie experience.\n\u2022 Watch Beasts of No Nation on Netflix now\n\u2022 Watch Beasts of No Nation's trailer on YouTube\nBest fantasy movies on Netflix\nThe Harry Potter collection\nAge ratings: PG and 12\nRuntimes: Between 138 minutes and 160 minutes\nMain cast: Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson, Rupert Grint, Alan Rickman, and Richard Harris\nDirectors: Chris Columbus, Mike Newell, Alfonso Cuaron, and David Yates\nRT scores: Between 77% and 96%\nRecommended by\nRecommended by\nTom Power\nThe incredibly popular Harry Potter films don't really need a formal introduction. For anyone who's been living in a cave for the last 15 years, though: they're based on J.K. Rowling's hugely successful fantasy book series, and tell the magical story of Harry Potter, a young wizard who attends Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Oh, and his increasingly dramatic and perilous conflict with Lord Voldemort, a dark wizard who wants to subjugate wizards and muggles (that's non-magic wielders) alike. Given the franchise's worldwide fanbase, the Harry Potter films were extraordinarily successful during their theatrical run between 2001 and 2011. Cumulatively, the octet raked in $7.7 billion globally, made overnight stars of its young cast, and cemented Harry Potter as the cultural phenomenon of our times. A TV series remake is currently in the works for Max, but we're unconvinced it'll capture the imagination, allure, and majesty of the films.

Everything about Mudbound is captivating, from the performance, soundtrack and direction. It's clear that Netflix were desperate to get their hands on this historical drama as the streamer paid $12.5m for the rights to distribute Mudbound, with Netflix taking the title of spending the most money on a single movie at the Sundance film festival in 2017.

In this self described 'zom-rom-com', Simon Pegg is brilliant as the titular character, a man going through relationship issues with his girlfriend, Liz. Before he really gets a chance to fix the mess he's made, an even bigger mess shows up in the form of the apocalypse, which brilliantly makes fun of the zombie genre with plenty of references, visual gags and quotable moments.

Steven Spielberg's classic horror thriller, which sees a giant great white shark terrorize a summer resort town, may be a tad on the outdated side these days (well, from an animatronic perspective, anyway). But there's no denying that one of the multi award-winning director's seminal films has inspired countless horror films since, not least those set in the unsettling depths of the world's oceans. From its tension-riddled plot, relatable characters, extraordinary technical achievement (again, for its time), masterful cinematography, and that iconic theme tune \u2013 all of which helped it to land numerous awards \u2013 Jaws is a jaw-dropping must-see shark movie. Find out where it ranks on our best Steven Spielberg movies list.\n\u2022 Watch Jaws on Netflix now\n\u2022 Watch Jaws' trailer on YouTube\nTalk to Me\nAge rating: 15\nRuntime: 94 minutes\nMain cast: Sophia Wilde, Miranda Otto, Otis Dhanji, Alexandra Jensen, and Joe Bird\nDirectors: Danny and Michael Philippou\nRT score: 95%\nRecommended by\nRecommended by\nTom Power\nTalk to Me follows a group of teenagers who discover they can talk to spirits using a mysterious severed and embalmed hand. Unsurprisingly, things go very, very wrong as they group mess with forces they can't control. Talk to Me is a terrifically devised, creepy, and gripping flick that *ahem* doesn't hold your hand throughout. Its cast is fantastic, its twists and turns horrifying, and its occasional jump scares are actually that \u2013 scary. Imbued with a violent energy that never crosses the line into cruelness or gratuitousness for the sake of it, this is a frighteningly good movie you'll want to watch more than once. A worthy inclusion in our best Netflix movies article.\n\u2022 Watch Talk to Me on Netflix now\n\u2022 Watch Talk to Me's trailer on YouTube\nThe Cabin in the Woods\nAge rating: 15\nRuntime: 95 minutes\nMain cast: Kristen Connolly, Chris Hemsworth, Anna Hutchison, Fran Kranz\nDirectors: Drew Goddard\nRT score: 92%\nRecommended by\nRecommended by\nLucy Buglass\nContinuing on with the trend of great comedy horrors, The Cabin in the Woods is another triumph. It takes everything you know about the typical slasher genre and turns it on its head. While scarier than Shaun of the Dead in terms of its suspense and jumpy moments, it is also very funny, and is accessible to newcomers to the genre as well as long-time horror fans. There's plenty of twists and turns here, as you never really know where it's going to go next. The performances here are also great, playing on those stereotypical horror tropes.\nWatch The Cabin in the Woods on Netflix now\nWatch The Cabin in the Woods' trailer on YouTube\nThe Lure\nAge rating: 15\nRuntime: 95 minutes\nMain cast: Kinga Preis, Michalina Olsza\u0144ska, Marta Mazurek, Jakub Giersza\u0142\nDirectors: Agnieszka Smoczynska\nRT score: 89%\nRecommended by\nRecommended by\nLucy Buglass\nThe Lure is a musical horror movie based on The Little Mermaid and honestly, if that doesn't sell it to you, I don't know what will. This wonderfully unique movie does one of my favourite things, taking fairy tales and making them thoroughly messed up. It's also a great place to start if you want to brush up on your knowledge of non-English language movies, as it was made by Polish filmmaker Agnieszka Smoczynska. This comes highly recommended if you want to try something a little more out there, you'll be glad you did.\nWatch The Lure on Netflix now\nWatch The Lure's trailer on YouTube\nBest romance movies on Netflix\nCall Me by Your Name\nAge rating: 15\nRuntime: 132 minutes\nMain cast: Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet, Armie Hammer, Michael Stuhlbarg, Esther Garral, Andr\u00e9 Aciman and Victoire Du Bois\nDirector: Luca Guadagnino\nRT score: 94%\nRecommended by\nRecommended by\nLucy Buglass\nCall Me by Your Name is another acclaimed masterpiece to add to director Luca Guadagnino's successful movie resume, prior to his other projects Challengers, Bones and All and Suspiria which established him as a treasured filmmaker in the world of arthouse cinema. The coming-of-age story propelled Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet to stardom with his role of teenager Elio, who falls in love with his father's handsome assistant Oliver (Armie Hammer). Although their relationship is temporary, Elio tries to come to terms with his sexual orientation.

The story is a classic boy meets girl scenario when London bookshop owner William Thacker (Hugh Grant) has a chance encounter with famous American actress Anna Scott (Julia Roberts). As the unassuming guy falls in love with the glamorous film star, the paparazzi's fascination with the couple complicates their relationship and they struggle to adapt their striking different lifestyles. While Notting Hill has a simple plot and may fall into the category as a stereotypical romance, Grant and Roberts' sublime performances make this a stand-out film and are no doubt one of the best roles of their careers. Also, who wouldn't want to see the suave Grant playing another charming and vulnerable romantic lead?\n\u2022 Watch Notting Hill on Netflix now\n\u2022 Watch Notting Hill's trailer on YouTube\nBest sci-fi movies on Netflix\nAttack the Block\nAge rating: 15\nRuntime: 88 minutes\nMain cast: John Boyega, Jodie Whittaker, Alex Esmail, Franz Drameh\nDirector: Joe Cornish\nRT score: 91%\nRecommended by\nRecommended by\nLucy Buglass\nAttack the Block is a mix of genres admittedly, but it's worthy of going alongside our sci-fi gems considering the otherworldly nature of the antagonists! In this science fiction comedy horror, we follow a teenage gang who have to defend themselves from alien invaders on a council estate in South London on Bonfire Night, so there's a lot going on. It's funny, it's gripping, it's a wild ride from start to finish and one of my favourite movies of all time. There's also some huge British stars here like John Boyega and Jodie Whittaker, so it's a real all-round achievement.\nWatch Attack the Block on Netflix now\nWatch Attack the Block's trailer on YouTube\nAnnihilation\nAge rating: 15\nRuntime: 115 minutes\nMain cast: Natalie Portman, Gina Rodriguez, Jennifer Jason Leigh, Tessa Thompson, and Oscar Isaac\nDirector: Alex Garland\nRT score: 88%\nRecommended by\nRecommended by\nTom Power\nEx Machina director Alex Garland helms this hypnotic adaptation of Jeff VanderMeer's novel of the same name, which follows a group of explorers \u2013 led by Natalie Portman's Lena \u2013 who enter 'The Shimmer', a mysterious, quarantined zone of mutating plants and animals. Sci-fi fans will find plenty of aliens to enjoy here, but Annihilation is also an ambitious psychological thriller that will leave you questioning the events of its final moments. Oscar Isaac also stars alongside Portman, which should be reason enough to give this one a go (that being said, the squeamish should look elsewhere).

Finally, though, months after the unexpectedly successful film\u2019s theatrical release, Netflix has not only secured its UK streaming rights, but it also surprisingly dropped the sci-fi horror epic on its platform on June 1. A new Japanese entry in Godzilla\u2019s packed back catalogue, Minus One returns to the iconic kaiju\u2019s roots with a destruction-filled and trauma-inducing tale set in postwar Japan. In it, the island nation desperately wrestles with the titanic monster\u2019s emergence from the deep and subsequently terrifying rampage across the Asian country. Easily one of 2023\u2019s best movies, Godzilla Minus One is a thematically rich, harrowing, and occasionally jaw-dropping spectacle.

To discuss its plot at length is to spoil its biggest surprises, but here's a brief synopsis to give you a flavor of what to expect: \"A series of eerie events thrusts an unlikely trio (Jamie Foxx, John Boyega, and Teyonah Parris) onto the trail of a nefarious government conspiracy in this pulpy mystery caper.\" We thoroughly enjoyed what it has to offer on multiple levels and our exclusive chat with John Boyega is well worth reading for a peak behind the curtain on its production.

Netflix was home to all three of the MCU's Tom Holland-starring films, however Spider-Man: No Way Home (which made it onto our best superhero movies list) and Spider-Man: Far From Home were both removed from the streaming platform.\nThe Sony Pictures-developed Marvel films have been on and off the streaming titan in recent years, but viewers can still enjoy the first instalment of the current wallcrawler in Spider-Man: Homecoming on British shores. Led by the charismatic Holland, and with a stellar supporting cast including Zendaya, Marisa Tomei, and Jacob Batalon, the MCU-set flick is as enjoyable and entertaining as it is dramatic and at-times tonally dark.

The dark comedy was released during the same year as The Menu and Triangle of Sadness, and builds on the satirical commentary about class and privilege that we've since seen become even more popular with films like Saltburn. On the surface, the plot might make it read like another teen horror about a house party that goes wrong, but it's much more clever than that. I'd say it was similar to other party game horror movies like Ready or Not and The Babysitter but sprinkled with some social satire to keep you thinking after the credits roll.\n\u2022 Watch Bodies Bodies Bodies on Netflix now\n\u2022 Watch the Bodies Bodies Bodies trailer\nWoman of the Hour\nAge rating: 15\nRuntime: 94 minutes\nMain cast: Anna Kendrick, Daniel Zovatto, Nicolette Robinson, Tony Hale\nDirector: Anna Kendrick\nRT score: 80%\nRecommended by\nRecommended by\nLucy Buglass\nWoman of the Hour is technically not a horror (it's more of a thriller), however I described it as the scariest movie I'd seen in 2024. There's good reason for that, because it's based on a chilling real life story about a woman named Sheryl Bradshaw, who had a run-in with the now infamous Dating Game killer before his horrific crimes had been exposed. Not only does this look at Rodney Alcala's killing spree, it most importantly looks at the women who fell under his charming spell, admit a sexist 70s Hollywood backdrop. It's a stunning directorial debut for Anna Kendrick, I'd love to see her do more like this.\n\u2022 Watch Woman of the Hour on Netflix now\n\u2022 Watch Woman of the Hour's trailer on YouTube\nGlass Onion: A Knives Out Mystery\nAge rating: 12A\nRuntime: 141 minutes\nMain cast: Daniel Craig, Edward Norton, Janelle Monae, Kathryn Hahn, Dave Bautista, Kate Hudson, and Leslie Odom Jr\nDirector: Rian Johnson\nRT score: 91%\nRecommended by\nRecommended by\nTom Power\nKnives Out wowed fans and critics alike in 2019, so sequels were understandably inevitable. The first of those \u2013 Glass Onion: A Knives Out Mystery \u2013 is another elaborate and highly entertaining whodunnit from director Rian Johnson. Buoyed by its excellent ensemble cast and a confidence carried over from its predecessor\u2019s success, Glass Onion is even showier and bolder than Knives Out \u2013 though the film proved exceptionally divisive among fans of Benoit Blanc's debut outing upon release. Still, fans of the murder mystery genre, Daniel Craig, and Johnson will be silly to miss out watching one of the best Netflix movies.\n\u2022 Watch Glass Onion: A Knives Out Mystery on Netflix now\n\u2022 Watch Glass Onion: A Knives Out Mystery's trailer on YouTube\nParasite\nAge rating: 15\nRuntime: 131 minutes\nMain cast: Song Kang-ho, Lee Sun-kyun, Jo Yeo-jeong, and Choi Woo-sik\nDirector: Bong Joon-ho\nRT score: 99%\nRecommended by\nRecommended by\nTom Power\nJoon-ho's 2020 Best Picture Oscar winner is now on Netflix \u2013 and, given it's one of the best films ever made (based on Rotten Tomatoes, anyway), it needs to be seen ASAP if you missed it during its original theatrical run. A black comedy-thriller, Parasite tells the story of an impoverished South Korean family who infiltrate a wealthy family's home and start living the life of luxury. Okay, that story synopsis doesn't sound all that appealing, but it belies Parasite's stunning exploration of socioeconomic hardship, class divide, wealth disparity, and late stage captialism.

The series of books by Suzanne Collins have since spawned a multi-billion dollar movie franchise that continues to grow. There are now five movies with a sixth called The Hunger Games: Sunrise on the Reaping scheduled to be released in theaters sometime in 2026. At the time of writing, you can stream the first four movies on Netflix but the 2023 prequel, The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes, isn't on the service (you'll have to head over to Prime Video to stream that).\n\u2022 Watch The Hunger Games on Netflix now\n\u2022 Watch The Hunger Games' trailer\nHow we choose the best Netflix movies\nNetflix is home to thousands of movies, so our entertainment experts have scoured the streamer's entire film library and handpicked the best new movies and older fare that are worth your time.
