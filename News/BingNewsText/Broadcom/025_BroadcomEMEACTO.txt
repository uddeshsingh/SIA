    "maintext": "What was once VMware is now Broadcom. With the acquisition closed, the American multinational brought its VMware Explore 2024 event to Barcelona from Nov. 4-7 with a new portfolio of solutions and an emphasis on its flagship private cloud platform, VMware Cloud Foundation (VCF).\nOn the stage, Joe Baguley, Broadcom\u2019s chief technology officer for EMEA, directed the focus towards the launch of new advanced VCF services, ecosystem partnerships and the definition of modernization programs whose purpose is to accelerate the development of generative artificial intelligence (AI) applications, cybersecurity initiatives and adoption of the sovereign cloud.\nComputerworld Spain had a chance to sit down with Baguley and talk about VMware\u2019s evolution and its current technology strategy.\nVMware\u2019s origins\nTo understand Baguley\u2019s career at the company, you have to look back 13 years and six months. Since then, he said, the transformation of the industry has been both incontestable and interesting. \u201cWhen I joined VMware, we only had a hypervisor \u2013 referring to a single software [instance] that can be used to run multiple virtual machines on a physical one \u2013 we didn\u2019t have storage or networking.\u201d\nBaguley recalled attending an internal R&D event with other senior managers of the organization. \u201cThat\u2019s where we came up with this vision: people would build private clouds with fully software-defined networks, storage and computing. That\u2019s what we would eventually call hyperconverged infrastructure.\u201d\nWith that picture in mind, the company has grown from \u201ca small company\u201d to the giant it is today, \u201can organization within a much larger one,\u201d Baguley said. For him, the journey to the present has been \u201cvery exciting.\u201d But, Baguley insisted, the most exciting thing, and what still keeps him in his office chair, is \u201cfeeling that we are still capable of carrying out that vision that we once conceived in a bar in Monterey.\u201d\nCorporate evolution\nSince those first steps, the organization has passed through several hands \u2013 including former parent company Dell EMC and equity stakeholder Silver Lake \u2013 until ending up with Broadcom, which finalized the acquisition of VMware in November 2023. Looking back, Baguley considers that the company\u2019s philosophy \u201chas not changed\u201d since its origins. \u201cAll we have done has been to complete\u201d the solutions portfolio, he said. \u201cWe have gone from choosing an operating system to being able to run any application anywhere and on any cloud by virtualizing storage.\u201d\n\u201cEverything we have done for customers over this time is simply to give them more options to manage their needs, from the sovereign cloud to the edge without forgetting the intrinsic security in all our products.\u201d They have done so, moreover, without overlooking simplicity: \u201cWe choose to empower people in a scenario where talent and technical skills are emerging as a challenge.\u201d\nIn the 25 years of the company\u2019s existence, the transformation has been undeniable. \u201cWe have evolved, we have refined those appendages that were not perfect.\u201d\nSince the acquisition of VMware by Broadcom, the organization has integrated the business units that previously advanced in isolation. \u201cComputing, networks, storage and security management used to operate in silos,\u201d Baguley said. Now, however, the great change they have experienced is that those silos have disappeared, the roadmap of all those individual components is driven under the heading of VCF. \u201cWe are seeing how our approach is already happening through customers.\u201d\nChampioning private cloud\nAsked about his position in the global market compared to competitors, Baguley is proud of the latest VMware innovations highlighted at the event, particularly related to the VCF platform.\n\u201cWhen it comes to building private clouds, we are the first. There is no one who can offer you a profile as broad and complete as ours.\u201d However, Baguley, aware of the high competitiveness of the industry in which they operate, maintained that \u201cif you look back at the history of technology, there have always been failures, barriers, stories where people have been too arrogant \u2026 As a technologist I am always aware that we cannot sit back, we must continually think about how to be relevant, strategic.\u201d\nIn the reputational sphere, the acquisition of VMware by Broadcom marked a turning point in the company\u2019s history. At VMworld Explore, spokespersons tried to dispel the negative publicity.\n\u201cWe have been through a lot. However, I think it has been really exciting, empowering as well. We have been able to better understand the needs of the market by adjusting the approach,\u201d Baguley said.\n\u201cMany people respect the innovation we do, they respect the work we do. From my point of view, it is key to understand where we are headed: We have to understand that, although it was not fashionable five years ago, the private cloud is the future. We have reached a level of technological maturity where people try to place the right application in the right location, and that place is the private cloud.\u201d",
