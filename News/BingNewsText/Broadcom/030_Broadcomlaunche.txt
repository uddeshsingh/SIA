    "maintext": "VMware by Broadcom has unveiled a new networking architecture that it says will improve the performance and security of distributed artificial intelligence (AI) \u2014 using AI and machine learning (ML) to do so.\nVeloRAIN (Robust AI Networking), launched Tuesday at the VMware Explore conference in Barcelona, Spain, will \u201cdeliver unprecedented visibility, prioritization, and automation for enterprise networks allowing organizations to operate more efficiently and deliver superior user experiences,\u201d the company said in a statement.\nThe company said it has identified a need for more intelligent edge networking and computing.\n[ Related: VMware Explore 2024: Latest news and insights ]\nIn a survey conducted by Broadcom in October, 57% of respondents cited the driver for edge computing and distributed AI at the edge is poor network connectivity between locations. And, the company said in its The State of the Enterprise Edge report presenting the survey, the top benefits respondents plan to achieve by implementing edge solutions are faster response times for latency-sensitive applications (68%) and improved bandwidth/reduced network congestion (65%).\nThe report was based on interviews conducted in September and October 2024 with 192 respondents across North America, South America, Africa, Europe, Asia, Australia, and New Zealand, plus VeloCloud Edge telemetry which, the company said, included the more than 5 trillion data points analyzed daily, across more than 300,000 edges and 3,700 gateways, representing more than 25,000 customers in 78 countries.\n\u201cEach stage of edge technology evolution is capable of transforming a variety of industries,\u201d the report noted. \u201cThe latest stage \u2014 the intelligent edge \u2014 is on the brink of rapid adoption. Deployment data shows that customers have taken steps to implement an AI-ready infrastructure by adopting cloud-first architecture, optimizing connectivity, and addressing security and compliance requirements. However, as AI workloads at the edge continue to proliferate, enterprises must take this moment to reassess their network infrastructure.\u201d\nThat\u2019s where VeloRAIN will come in.\n\u201cVeloRAIN is the foundation of our AI networking innovation, empowering our entire portfolio to better address the demands of enterprise AI workloads,\u201d said Sanjay Uppal, vice president and general manager, VeloCloud Division, Broadcom, in a statement. \u201cBy harnessing the advanced capabilities of VeloRAIN, AI workloads from distributed inferencing and agentic peer-to-peer applications to upstream heavy RAG transactions will see improved application-based QoE [Quality of Experience] and security across all endpoints of the enterprise.\u201d\nVeloRAIN capabilities\nVeloRAIN\u2019s capabilities will include the detection of AI applications using AI and ML, even if the application traffic is encrypted, to enable quality of service (QoS) and QoE for edge AI applications, the company said. It will offer channel estimation intelligence for wireless connections over cellular or satellite to help enable what Broadcom called \u201cfiber-like QoS in the face of dynamically changing network conditions.\u201d\nIn addition, new applications will be automatically identified and assigned business priorities to insure that critical applications get the necessary attention without manual intervention.\nDynamic Application-Based Slicing, or DABS, will assure QoE per application across multiple disparate underlying networks, whether they support network layer slicing or not, Uppal said during a media briefing. DABS also includes user profiles, so traffic can be prioritized based on a user\u2019s identity.\n\u201cOne of the things that we discovered when we were measuring AI applications is that the reason why all this makes sense now, and the importance of getting this done for AI, is because the applications themselves are extremely different,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd they\u2019re different because the patterns are different. The way that they use the network is different. They\u2019re very bursty. They\u2019re highly latency sensitive.\u201d\nZeus Kerravala, principal analyst at ZK Research, agreed. \u201cFor today\u2019s CIO, they need to understand that AI will be the biggest disruptor to networks since the cloud,\u201d he said. \u201cIn fact, in a recent survey I did, I asked the question, \u2018What are your organization\u2019s biggest network challenges?\u2019 and the top response, ahead of cyber security, was supporting AI workloads.\n\u201cOne of the most compelling features of VeloRAIN is the ability to recognize and prioritize AI traffic. That\u2019s certainly unique to VeloCloud.\u201d\nAnother analyst immediately saw some real-world applications for the new offering.\n\u201cIn some ways, this builds on what Broadcom launched with VCF 9, focusing on connectivity across the entirety of the enterprise,\u201d Matt Kimball, vice president and principal analyst, datacenter compute & storage, at Moor Insights & Strategy, observed. \u201cVeloRAIN is really interesting, and I can see the real-world application right away. The need for secure, dedicated connectivity across the enterprise \u2014 from the datacenter to the edge \u2014 is critical to making AI at the edge real and viable. This seems to be where Broadcom is has trained its focus. The channel estimation intelligence should be especially useful as it ensures that ever important QoS despite those network performance changes that impact virtually every company.\u201d\nJohn Annand, practice lead at Info-Tech Research Group, also saw the connection to previous announcements, noting that VMware had hinted at VeloRAIN in August at VMware Explore in Las Vegas. He has confidence in Broadcom\u2019s ability to solve networking issues.\n\u201cAs a long-time infrastructure nerd, I\u2019m somewhat of a professional skeptic, but if anyone could figure out wire speed packet and path optimization that could avoid starving expensive GPUs or muddling their order of operations, causing time consuming restarts of complex AI calculations, I\u2019d put my money on Broadcom,\u201d he said. \u201cBroadcom knows how to solve routing problems, so of course, they\u2019re going to lean into that solution set to help solve the AI over Ethernet problem.\u201d\nHowever, he said, \u201cwe\u2019re all meant to think that VeloRAIN is about AI workloads; it\u2019s right there in the name, after all. The immediate practical benefit, however, will be consuming Broadcom-built, VMware product-delivered AI technologies without the need for governance, strategies, and ethics boards to improve network operations and end-user experience. For I&O [infrastructure and operations] leaders looking to get the innovation check mark \u2014 yes, this will help future-proof you for an eventual private AI cluster. And maybe that is enough to help you get budget to improve those core network services that are the unsung heroes supporting IT\u2019s reputation!\u201d",
