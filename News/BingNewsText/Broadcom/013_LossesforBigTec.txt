    "maintext": "Technology stocks helped pull stocks lower on Wall Street Wednesday, handing the market its first loss in more than a week.\nThe S&P 500 fell 0.4%, even though more stocks in the index notched gains than ended lower. The loss snapped a seven-day winning streak for the benchmark index.\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.3%, its first loss after five gains. The Dow and S&P 500 remain near the all-time highs they set on Tuesday.\nThe Nasdaq composite, which is heavily weighted with technology stocks, fell 0.6%.\nLosses for tech heavyweights like Nvidia, Microsoft and Broadcom were the drag on the market. Shares of semiconductor giant Nvidia fell 1.2%. Its huge value gives it outsized influence on market indexes. Microsoft shares fell 1.2% and Broadcom finished 3.1% lower.\nSeveral personal computer makers also helped pull the market lower following their latest earnings reports.\nHP shares sank 11.4% after giving investors a weaker-than-expected earnings forecast for its current quarter. Dell stock slid 12.2% after its latest quarterly revenue fell short of Wall Street forecasts.\nGains for financial and health care companies helped temper the market's losses. Berkshire Hathaway shares rose 0.9% and Merck & Co. added 1.5%.\nAll told, the S&P 500 fell 22.89 points to 5,998.74, while the Dow dropped 138.25 points to 44,722.06. The Nasdaq fell 115.10 points to 19,060.48.\nTraders also had their eye on new reports on the economy and inflation Wednesday.\nThe U.S. economy expanded at a healthy 2.8% annual pace from July through September, according to the Commerce Department, leaving its original estimate of third-quarter growth unchanged. The growth was driven by strong consumer spending and a surge in exports.\nThe update followed a report on Tuesday from the Conference Board that said confidence among U.S. consumers improved in November, but not by as much as economists expected.\nConsumers have been driving economic growth, but the latest round of earnings reports from retailers shows a mixed and more cautious picture.\nShares of department store operator Nordstrom fell 8.1% after warning investors about a trend toward weakening sales that started in late October.\nClothing retailer Urban Outfitters jumped 18.3% after beating analysts' third-quarter financial forecasts. Weeks earlier, retail giant Target gave investors a discouraging forecast for the Christmas holiday season, while Walmart provided a more encouraging forecast.\nConsumers, though resilient, are still facing pressure from inflation. The latest update from the U.S. government shows that inflation accelerated last month.\nThe personal consumption expenditures index, or PCE, rose to 2.3% in October from 2.1% in September.\nOverall, the rate of inflation has been falling broadly since it peaked more than two years ago. The PCE, which is the Federal Reserve's preferred measure of inflation, was just below 7.3% in June of 2022.\nAnother measure of inflation, the consumer price index, peaked at 9.1% at the same time.\nThe latest data, though, is a sign that the rate of inflation seems to be stalling as it falls to within range of the Fed's target of 2%. The central bank started raising its benchmark interest rate from near-zero in early 2022 to a two-decade high by the middle of 2023 and held it there in order to tame inflation.\nThe Fed started cutting its benchmark interest rate in September, followed by a second cut in November. Wall Street expects a similar quarter-point cut at the central bank's upcoming meeting in December.\n\"Today's data shouldn't change views of the likely path for disinflation, however bumpy,\" said David Alcaly, lead macroeconomic strategist at Lazard Asset Management.\n\"But a lot of observers, probably including some at the Fed, are looking for reasons to get more hawkish on the outlook given the potential for inflationary policy change like new tariffs.\"\nPresident-elect Donald Trump has said he plans to impose sweeping new tariffs on Mexico, Canada and China when he takes office in January. That could shock the economy by raising prices on a wide range of goods and accelerating the rate of inflation. Such a shift could prompt the Fed to rethink future cuts to interest rates.\nTreasury yields slipped in the bond market. The yield on the 10-year Treasury fell from Tuesday's 4.30% to to 4.25%. The yield on the two-year Treasury, which more closely follows expected actions by the Fed, fell from Tuesday's 4.25% to 4.22%.\nU.S. markets will be closed Thursday for Thanksgiving and will reopen for a half day on Friday.",
