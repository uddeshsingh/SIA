    "description": "Broadcom currently trades at $165.14 and has been a dream stock for shareholders. It\u2019s returned 431% since November 2019, blowing past the S&P 500\u2019s 87.9% gain. The company has also beaten the index over the past six months as its stock price is up 16.8%. This was partly thanks to its solid quarterly results, and the run-up might have investors contemplating their next move.",
