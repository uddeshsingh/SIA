    "maintext": "We recently compiled a list of the Billionaire Ken Fisher\u2019s Top 15 Stock Picks Heading Into 2025. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) stands against Ken Fisher\u2019s other top stock picks.\nKen Fisher is the founder of Fisher Asset Management, a financial adviser that he started nearly five decades ago. The firm oversees over $240 billion from more than 150,000 private investors.\nFisher said, \u201cI\u2019ve gone to cash three times in my career; in 1987 before the crash, before the 1990 bear market and in the early 2000s, before the dot-com crash. But I missed the 2007-2009 bear market because I didn\u2019t believe, and don\u2019t believe, mortgages could cause what they are blamed for having caused.\u201d\nBesides focusing on long-term investments, Fisher also believes in spreading out investments to reduce risk. Fisher Asset Management is highly diversified, with a portfolio value of about $244 billion. While technology stocks account for 31.8% of the portfolio, the independent money management firm is also heavily invested in the services sector, accounting for 14.6% of the portfolio. Other significant holdings are in the financial services, healthcare, and basic materials sectors.\nIn the past year, Fisher\u2019s firm made a 32.18% return, mainly because it invested a lot in tech stocks, especially those benefiting from the AI boom. While other managers are selling tech stocks due to high valuations, Fisher\u2019s firm is buying more, especially in companies making AI chips.\nREAD ALSO: 8 Most Undervalued Pot Stocks to Buy According to Analysts and 99% of Billionaire Abrams\u2019 Portfolio is in These 11 Stocks.\nEven though the overall market is at all-time highs, Fisher says there\u2019s no need to worry. He believes that just because the market is high now, it doesn\u2019t predict the future. He expects the market to keep going up as long as the economy and other key factors get better.\n\u201cBull markets hit new highs on an ongoing basis as soon as they have recovered from the prior bear market and hit their first all-time high in that new bull market. They keep doing that over and over again and eventually you do get another bear market and then again get another bull market. Bull markets, not always, are usually significantly bigger and longer than bear markets, significantly,\u201d Ken Fisher said.\nKen Fisher\u2019s portfolio is heavily invested in the \u201cmagnificent seven\u201d stocks, based on the belief that the stocks are well poised to continue outperforming the overall market. According to Fisher, growth stocks will continue outperforming value stocks amid the prevailing economic conditions.\n\u201cIf you think the market is going up, you should expect the magnificent seven to continue to do well. Will they necessarily do better than everything? No, but they never actually did. The fact is they did better as a group than most groups you could find. I think that will continue to be the case because I am optimistic on the market as a whole moving forward\u201d, Fisher said in a video interview.\nOur Methodology\nWe looked through Fisher Asset Management\u2019s portfolio to find Ken Fisher\u2019s top 15 stock picks for 2025. We focused on his biggest investments and ranked the stocks from smallest to largest based on the firm\u2019s stake at the end of Q3 2024.\nAt Insider Monkey, we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into.
