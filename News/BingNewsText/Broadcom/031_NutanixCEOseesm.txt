    "maintext": "Historically, data center virtualization pioneer VMware was seen as a technology leader, but recent business changes have stirred consternation since its acquisition by Broadcom in late 2023. New product bundling and pricing, reseller program adjustments, divestments, and unforeseen changes are driving CIOs and IT providers to reassess their strategies and technologies.\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to change the relationship customers have with the company because Broadcom\u2019s focus is on running as efficiently as possible,\u201d said Rajiv Ramaswami, president and CEO of Nutanix, in an April 2024 episode of Bloomberg\u2019s Tech Disruptors podcast.\n\u201cThat means for customers: price increases, potentially less support\u2026and that\u2019s creating a disruption in the channel partner community,\u201d he said. \u201cFor us, it\u2019s a multi-year opportunity.\u201d\nIndustry changes and fallout from disgruntled Broadcom VMware customers have been widely reported. In January 2024, The Wall Street Journal highlighted the attention Broadcom\u2019s VMware overhaul drew from CIOs, followed by reports of pricing and reseller agreement changes. The Register later noted \u201cwhispers about a breakup with AWS,\u201d despite Broadcom addressing the issue in a blog post. Many customers remain wary, prompting IT leaders to explore alternatives and adjust their strategies regarding VMware products.\nOn the Tech Disruptors podcast, Ramaswami outlined how Nutanix is meeting the rising demand for simplified IT infrastructure and positioning itself as the easiest alternative for VMware customers seeking to reduce risk or dependence.\nPodcast host Woo Jin Ho, an analyst at Bloomberg, said: \u201cFrom my math, it looks like [Broadcom] cut out roughly 10,000 channel partners out of their 28,000. [They are] now down to 18,000. Does that potentially expand the channel partner program for you guys?\u201d\nRamaswami confirmed.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve certainly seen a higher level of engagement with many channel partners,\u201d Ramaswami said, highlighting a recent announcement that WiPro created a Nutanix Business Unit to accelerate digital transformation and hybrid multicloud innovation.\nMany joint Nutanix and VMware partners are looking to renew their Nutanix partnership, especially those losing out of the top 2000 customers.\n\u201cMany customers who knew the Broadcom playbook signed three to five-year enterprise agreements with VMware before the deal was closed,\u201d Ramaswami said, adding this bought them time.\nMany see Nutanix as \u201cthe easiest alternative,\u201d he said. \u201cNot everybody is going to do wholesale migrations. Many might adopt a dual vendor strategy and might use Nutanix in a portion of the business.\u201d\nWoo recognized the rising significance of hybrid multicloud following the COVID pandemic, a time that accelerated digital transformation to accommodate remote work and the surge in online commerce.\n\u201cPeople are finding that steady-state workloads can be run much more effectively and cost-effectively in their own data centers,\u201d said Ramaswami, highlighting how X (formerly Twitter) optimized its cloud usage, shifting more on-premises and cutting monthly cloud costs by 60%, data storage by 60%, and data processing costs by 75%.\nThis is prompting the CIO shift to hybrid and multicloud.\nIn Nutanix\u2019s recent Enterprise Cloud Index (ECI) \u2013 which surveyed 1,500 IT, DevOps, and platform engineering leaders globally \u2013 over 80% of organizations viewed hybrid IT as essential for managing applications and data. Nearly half indicated that implementing hybrid IT is a top priority for their CIO.\nThe interview hinted CIOs are cautious with their IT budgets and that while there is spending it\u2019s with a total cost-of-ownership (TCO) mindset.\n\u201cWe have a TAM (total addressable market) of about $76 billion and that includes software-defined compute, storage, and networking,\u201d Ramaswami said. Disruption from the Broadcom-VMware acquisition \u201cgives us an opportunity to grow [market] share faster than we probably normally have into that TAM. I would see this as an acceleration.\u201d\nRamaswami discussed growth among both large Global 2000 and smaller companies globally, with many looking to expand their use of Nutanix. A major APAC company that ran a dual Nutanix and VMware strategy recently chose Nutanix over VMware for an expansion, while smaller customers show potential for full migration to Nutanix.\nAnd he noted, after the Broadcom deal closed, a smaller public healthcare system accelerated its shift to Nutanix, finishing in just 90 days.\n\u201cWe have done a lot of work on automating migrations for simpler environments, but also for very complex environments,\u201d said Ramaswami.\nLearn how Nutanix can accelerate your hybrid cloud journey and transform your business.\nDisclaimer: Nutanix, Inc. is not affiliated with VMware by Broadcom or Broadcom.",
