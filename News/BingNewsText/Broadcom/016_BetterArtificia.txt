    "maintext": "Among the companies benefiting from artificial intelligence (AI) entering the mainstream are semiconductor giants Broadcom (AVGO 2.73%) and Nvidia (NVDA 0.28%). The arrival of AI supercharged sales for both businesses as customers sought the necessary hardware and software to implement AI into their organizations.\nAs a result, Broadcom stock skyrocketed to a 52-week high of $186.42 in October, a dramatic change from the $90.31 low it was at last December. Nvidia also saw its stock soar over the past year, from last December's 52-week low of $45.01 to a high of $152.89 as of Nov. 21.\nBoth remain in a position to continue benefiting from AI-related demand, which shows no signs of abating. Industry forecasts estimate the AI market will experience a multi-year expansion from around $184 billion this year to over $826 billion by 2030.\nWith Broadcom and Nvidia both doing well, is one a better investment to capitalize on the growing AI market? Here's a comparison of each to help you arrive at an answer.\nBroadcom's AI approach\nBroadcom's ability to capture AI demand lies in its expansive semiconductor business. It offers an array of products for tech industries such as computer networking, storage, and broadband.\nSo it's understandable that the emergence of AI has powered sales growth for the company. In its fiscal third quarter, ended Aug. 4, Broadcom delivered $13.1 billion in revenue, a 47% year-over-year increase.\nIts networking hardware, in particular, benefited from AI demand, as sales in this area rose 43% year over year to $4 billion. But softness in non-AI related sales meant the division's overall Q3 revenue growth was just 5% year over year to $7.3 billion.\nThe other major area of Broadcom's business, software to manage IT infrastructure, grew a whopping 200% year over year to $5.8 billion thanks to the company's acquisition of VMware last November. The VMware Cloud Foundation (VCF) platform enables Broadcom's customers to establish a private AI.\nPrivate AI protects customer data from use by AI other than those designated by the customers. Broadcom tackling the nascent private AI market is proving to be a masterful strategy. Customer demand for the technology led to VCF comprising over 80% of VMware's Q3 product bookings.\nNvidia's AI success\nNvidia has been one of the biggest beneficiaries of the fervor over AI because of its focus on accelerated computing. This type of computer architecture processes data-intensive tasks separately from the work handled by a CPU, making it ideal for complex tech such as AI.\nNvidia championed accelerated computing with the creation of its graphics processing unit (GPU) in 1999. The company is now recognized as the world leader in GPUs with some estimates placing its market share at 80%.\nResults for its fiscal third quarter, ended Oct. 27, proved it remains a leader in the accelerated computing space. It achieved record Q3 revenue of $35.1 billion, up 94% from the prior year.\nThe company expects this sales growth to continue into Q4 with revenue estimated to reach around $37.5 billion. That's a 70% increase over the previous year's $22.1 billion.\nNvidia is likely to continue seeing sales supercharged by AI demand. According to CEO Jensen Huang, \"AI is transforming every industry, company and country.\" To his point, Denmark and Japan used Nvidia products to build AI supercomputers.\nChoosing between Broadcom and Nvidia stock\nWith Broadcom and Nvidia both seeing success in their AI-related offerings, it's not easy to decide which wins out as the better AI investment. One consideration is to look at the diluted earnings per share (EPS) for each company.\nAs the chart shows, once AI demand exploded in 2023, Nvidia's EPS rocketed up while Broadcom's declined. Over its last three fiscal quarters, Broadcom's net income dropped to $1.6 billion from $10.6 billion in the previous year as it dealt with higher expenses related to its VMware acquisition.\nAnother factor to weigh is the price-to-earnings ratio (P/E ratio) for each company. This metric tells you how much investors are willing to pay for every dollar of earnings, which helps you to assess the relative value of a stock.",
