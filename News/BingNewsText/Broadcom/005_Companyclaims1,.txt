    "maintext": "Companies have been discussing migrating off of VMware since Broadcom\u2019s takeover a year ago led to higher costs and other controversial changes. Now we have an inside look at one of the larger customers that recently made the move.\nAccording to a report from The Register today, Beeks Group, a cloud operator headquartered in the United Kingdom, has moved most of its 20,000-plus virtual machines (VMs) off VMware and to OpenNebula, an open source cloud and edge computing platform. Beeks Group sells virtual private servers and bare metal servers to financial service providers. It still has some VMware VMs, but \u201cthe majority\u201d of its machines are currently on OpenNebula, The Register reported.\nBeeks\u2019 head of production management, Matthew Cretney, said that one of the reasons for Beeks' migration was a VMware bill for \u201c10 times the sum it previously paid for software licenses,\u201d per The Register.\nAccording to Beeks, OpenNebula has enabled the company to dedicate more of its 3,000 bare metal server fleet to client loads instead of to VM management, as it had to with VMware. With OpenNebula purportedly requiring less management overhead, Beeks is reporting a 200 percent increase in VM efficiency since it now has more VMs on each server.\nBeeks also pointed to customers viewing VMware as non-essential and a decline in VMware support services and innovation as drivers for it migrating from VMware.\nBroadcom didn't respond to Ars Technica's request for comment.\nBroadcom loses VMware customers\nBroadcom will likely continue seeing some of VMware's older customers decrease or abandon reliance on VMware offerings. But Broadcom has emphasized the financial success it has seen (PDF) from its VMware acquisition, suggesting that it will continue with its strategy even at the risk of losing some business.\nBeeks is just one company that has moved away from Broadcom's VMware. But its story underscores the ongoing challenges Broadcom has in pacifying customers who have felt disrupted by the changes it has implemented.\nIgnacio Llorente, CEO at OpenNebula Systems, told Ars that \"several relevant organizations\" are moving from VMware to OpenNebula but that he couldn't disclose specifics. He added:\nIn our experience, recent price increases have prompted these companies to explore alternative solutions. At its core, this is a matter of trust\u2014many organizations feel they can no longer rely on VMware or other vendors that distribute proprietary components.\nLike Beeks, other VMware customers have claimed costs for working with VMware skyrocketed due to Broadcom ending perpetual license sales (a move Broadcom has claimed was planned before Broadcom bought VMware) and combining VMware's previously bountiful SKUs into a small number of bundles. Ars spoke to numerous customers who have said that their VMware costs increased 300 percent under Broadcom.\nSimilarly to Beeks, AT&T previously claimed that Broadcom proposed new pricing that would have resulted in AT&T\u2019s VMware costs increasing by 1,050 percent. AT&T sued Broadcom for not renewing perpetual license support, but the companies have since settled.\nBroadcom sought to appease small- and medium-sized businesses with a new, more SMB-friendly subscription tier announced last month. The move came amid concerns that Broadcom was primarily interested in enterprise-size customers for VMware and was overlooking the needs of smaller firms. But Broadcom\u2019s changes have already pushed many customers to research alternatives to VMware, including rivals like OpenNebula.\nAnd with customers struggling to juggle new, higher costs associated with using and selling VMware, we can expect more companies to find ways to decrease dependence on VMware, just as Beeks has.",
