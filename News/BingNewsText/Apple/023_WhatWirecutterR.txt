    "maintext": "Published December 2, 2024\nBy The Wirecutter Deals Team\nThe Wirecutter Deals team hunts for and highlights only the best discounts on Wirecutter picks made by our editorial experts.\nIt\u2019s easy to get swept up in the chaos and clich\u00e9s of Cyber Monday, when every online retailer you\u2019ve ever visited is flooding your inbox and claiming to offer the biggest deals of the year.\nWirecutter readers know there\u2019s a better way: trusting our team of expert journalists to make thoughtful recommendations of products that we know will last at prices that aren\u2019t too good to be true. That\u2019s because we feature only deals on things that we\u2019ve vetted and tested ourselves, and we\u2019ve double-checked the sale prices to confirm that they\u2019re really as good as they seem.\nEven so, there are some Cyber Monday discounts that have grabbed our readers\u2019 attention more than others.\nSo here are the 30-plus Cyber Monday deals that Wirecutter readers have loved the most, including a sweet pair of diamond hoops, a set of stainless steel forever pans, and a (dare we say) sleek pair of Crocs. If you\u2019re looking for the most tightly curated collection of sure-to-please Cyber Monday discounts, you can\u2019t do much better than this list\u2014but if you still want to see everything else that\u2019s on sale, check out our main Cyber Monday deals roundup.\nAdvertisement\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT\nA cordless vibrator we\u2019ve recommended for years\nBuying Options\n$110 $92 from Lovehoney\nUse promo code WC-MAGICWAND92\nWhat we like: Our top vibrator pick. Cordless and rechargeable. Many testers called this their go-to toy for clitoral stimulation. Offers great variation in intensity and vibration patterns. Durable with an easy-to-clean silicone head. Quiet (but not that quiet) motor. Sufficient battery life.\nOther things to know: Large size can make it difficult to use in certain positions during partnered intercourse. Not waterproof. Automatically shuts off at the 20-minute mark. A beautiful toy this is not, but it gets the job done. One-year warranty. Use code WC-MAGICWAND92.\nRead more: The Best Vibrators\nA suitcase tracker for peace of mind\nBuying Options\n$100 $70 from Amazon (pack of four)\nYou save $30 (30%)\n$100 $70 from Best Buy (pack of four)\nYou save $30 (30%)\nWhat we like: Our top Bluetooth tracker pick for iPhone users. Also recommended in multiple Wirecutter gift guides. Impressively accurate in pinpointing an item\u2019s precise location. Leverages Apple\u2019s extensive Find My network. Can swap in a new battery as needed. Water-resistant.\nOther things to know: Doesn\u2019t have any way to ring your phone. Cannot attach to your stuff directly. Sales on four-packs typically offer the best price per tracker, but we\u2019ve seen better deals in recent months.\nRead more: The Best Bluetooth Tracker\nAdvertisement\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT\nA suction vibe that\u2019s easy to store\nBuying Options\n$48 $34 from Amazon\nYou save $14 (29%)\nWhat we like: Another good suction vibrator we recommend. High performance, costs less than our top pick. The opening is comfortable for a larger clitoris.\nOther things to know: Shape and size of an asthma inhaler. We preferred the Dame Aer\u2019s gentler, more versatile stimulation.\nRead more: The Best Vibrators\nA modern bedside clock for phone detoxing\nBuying Options\n$20 $17 from Amazon\nYou save $3 (15%)\nWhat we like: Our top unique and informative digital alarm clock pick. Triangular wooden body looks upscale and is also tip-proof. You can set the display to turn off automatically after 10 seconds and just tap the clock\u2019s face to wake it up again. Displays more information at a glance than any other clock we recommend.\nOther things to know: Navigating the clock\u2019s mode settings and feature adjustments is unintuitive. USB cable is included; four AAA batteries for emergency power backup are not included.\nRead more: The Best Alarm Clocks\nAdvertisement\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT\nThe Swiss Army knife of travel backpacks\nBuying Options\n$300 $240 from Backcountry\nYou save $60 (20%)\n$300 $240 from Amazon\nYou save $60 (20%)\n$300 $240 from REI\n(deal on black)\n$300 $240 from Best Buy\n(deal on sage)\n$300 $240 from Peak Design\n(deal on the 45L size)\nWhat we like: Our top large carry-on travel backpack pick. Easy accessibility. Clever tuck-away straps. Elegant way of expanding and contracting. Design is adjustable, customizable, and (if you spring for the extra cubes and organizers) an almost perfect system for photographers and gearheads.\nOther things to know: Lifetime warranty. Committing to the entire system of packing cubes and camera cubes adds extra cost to an already expensive bag. Not the absolute best sale we\u2019ve seen, but a good deal.\nRead more: The Best Carry-On Travel Backpacks\nA vacuum that\u2019s a breeze to maneuver\nBuying Options\n$700 $400 from Dyson\nYou save $300 (43%)\n$700 $400 from Walmart\nYou save $300 (43%)\nWhat we like: Our top pick for the best cordless stick vacuum.

Simple to set up, sturdy, and Bluetooth-enabled. Comfortable to walk on for long periods of time, and light enough to move around on its two front wheels. Smoothly accelerates to its top speed of 7.5 mph.\nOther things to know: Doesn\u2019t have a dynamic display screen for tracking workout vitals or streaming shows. Only a 90-day warranty. During testing we noticed the belt start to fray along the edge. Can safely accommodate up to 265 pounds, more than most models and our other pick.\nRead more: The Best Under-Desk Treadmill\nAdvertisement\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT\nAn iPad with a crisp, bright screen\nBuying Options\n$570 $500 from Target\nYou save $70 (12%)\n$570 $500 from Best Buy\nYou save $70 (12%)\n$570 $500 from Amazon\nWith delayed shipping (deal on blue)\n$850 $800 from Amazon (13-inch, 256 GB)\n(deal on blue)\n$850 $800 from Target (13-inch, 256 GB)\n(deal on gray and blue)\n$850 $800 from Best Buy (13-inch, 256 GB)\nYou save $50 (6%)\nWhat we like: Our upgrade pick for the best tablet.

They sound good and are very comfortable. A test tone calibrates the noise reduction to your ear shape, and it works well, reducing a lot of noise in the airplane band.\nOther things to know: Available in four colors. Noise reduction is second only to that of the Apple AirPods Max and a little better than that of our previous top pick, the discontinued Bose 700. Not as many bonus features as the price suggests. We wish the microphones did better in loud environments.\nRead more: The Best Noise-Cancelling Headphones\nA toiletry bag to stay organized in style\nBuying Options\n$75 $55 from State Bags\nUse promo code BF24, price includes shipping\nWhat we like: Our top pick for the most versatile toiletry bag.

Has a hook and a removable plastic pouch.\nOther things to know: Usually the most expensive toiletry bag we recommend. Detachable plastic pouch isn\u2019t as waterproof as it appears. Within a few dollars of the lowest price we\u2019ve posted. Use code BF24.

Strikes a solid balance between quality and affordability. Two-piece design combines the appearance of a traditional floor rug with some of the feel and function of carpet tiles.\nOther things to know: Edges may curl and lift up. Corners and edges will get more wear and tear in high-traffic areas. We specifically highlight this rug in our guide, but Ruggable offers a variety of options in multiple patterns and sizes.

Made of 100% US-grown Supima cotton.\nOther things to know: Relatively expensive but costs a fraction of the price of similar lattice towels imported from Japan. Waffle towels are prone to snags.
