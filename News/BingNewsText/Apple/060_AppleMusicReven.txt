    "maintext": "iTunes and the iPod revolutionized the music industry in the early 2000s, as the hardware and software duo which popularized singles over albums and allowed users to store thousands of songs on a single device.\nThat now seems quaint, but for over a decade it was the way most people listened to music. Apple held a lead over all other music players with the iPod, which was catapulted further ahead by the iPhone.\nHowever, Apple failed to see music streaming as the next evolution of digital music, with CEO Steve Jobs vehemently against it. Instead, for half a decade, a small Swedish developer was able to grow with hardly any serious competition.\n- Advertisement -\nSpotify had already accumulated 22 million subscribers by the time Apple Music launched. It also had 68 million users on freemium accounts. YouTube had also cornered the market on music videos, another market Apple missed.\nThe acquisition of Beats Electronics for $3 billion was the first sign Apple were willing to try music streaming. It closed Beats Music and launched Apple Music in June 2015, with a lot of artists coming out to support the app. Apple also launched several radio stations featuring prominent artists and DJs, including ex-BBC Zane Lowe and Ebro Darden.\nApple Music hit the ground running with 11 million subscribers in the first year, even with criticism of the user interface. A year after launch, Apple Music received its first major redesign, fixing many of the interface issues.\nSince then, Apple Music has steadily grown into a genuine competitor to Spotify, especially in the US where it is the largest music streaming service. In Europe and South America, Spotify is still king, and Apple may struggle to ever reach Spotify\u2019s numbers due to its poorly optimized Android app.\nWe have collected data and statistics on Apple Music.
