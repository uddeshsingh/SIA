When iOS 18.1 launched in September, a couple of Apple Intelligence features appeared but it\u2019s iOS 18.2 that\u2019s set to bring the real meat of Apple\u2019s AI.\nIf you\u2019re running the iOS 18.2 beta then you\u2019ll already have access to some of the features coming, which includes an expansion of the Writing Tools.\nIn iOS 18.1, the Writing Tools offered a way to rewrite an email or document into a more \u2018Professional\u2019 or \u2018Friendly\u2019 tone, and it could also proofread and summarise text anywhere you\u2019d find a cursor too.\nBut, with the next software update, ChatGPT gets baked into Siri, as 9to5Mac highlighted in a recent report, and that brings with it some extra tricks. Within the Writing Tools menu, you\u2019ll see \"Compose\", which will enable Siri and ChatGPT to compose words from scratch. You still need to give guidance as to what you want to be written, but you won\u2019t have to write the words yourself beyond the instruction.\nOnce ChatGPT has composed your copy, you can then refine it. You can either ask for an entire rewrite, or you can tap on the \"Describe your change\" for a customised AI rewrite.\nApple has said iOS 18.2 is due to be released to iPhone users in December, though the company hasn\u2019t confirmed the exact date as yet. Along with the more advanced Writing Tools, iOS 18.2 is set to bring features like the Hearing Test for AirPods Pro 2 users.",
