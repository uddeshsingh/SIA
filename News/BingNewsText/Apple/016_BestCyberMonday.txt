    "maintext": "If you have an Apple fan on your holiday shopping list, you\u2019re in luck. There are some great Cyber Monday deals on Apple Watches, AirPods, iPads, and MacBooks.\nYou\u2019ll find big price drops on a few older models and more modest discounts on, say, the new Apple Watch 10. Keep in mind that the best deals involve more than a low price. So we look closely at the results from our lab tests when choosing the items to spotlight here to make certain you get great performance, too.\nFor even more holiday discounts on everything from home goods to luggage to TVs and more, check out our Deals hub.\nThis 13-inch model has Apple\u2019s latest M3 processor, which delivers strong performance while sipping at the battery. Combine that with the barely-there 2.7-pound weight and it\u2019s easy to see why the Air continues to be so popular. The model we tested is slightly more powerful, with 16GB of memory and a 512GB solid state drive, but this base model (8GB of RAM and a 256GB drive) has plenty of muscle for the average user. To save a bit more, consider the 2022 version of the Macbook Air, with the older M2 chip.\nThin, light, and powerful, the 2022 MacBook Air remains a great machine, providing a compelling combination of performance and battery life. It\u2019s powered by Apple\u2019s M2 processor, which performs with admirable speed and efficiency. The newer MacBook Air has a more powerful M3 chip under the hood, but if you\u2019re doing everyday tasks (streaming movies, browsing social media, doing regular online things), you\u2019re unlikely to perceive a difference. Just note that we\u2019ve seen this model sell for $699.\nThe MacBook Air has been a great choice for consumers since the first model was released way back in 2008. This one\u2014outfitted with Apple\u2019s homegrown M1 processor\u2014debuted in 2020 and is still a compelling choice. (Heck, this copy was written on one!) And the model is now selling at a price so low it practically requires a double take.\nThe AirPods Max are cool, sound really good, and have superb and flexible noise canceling. However, this is a modest discount. At their normal street price of $500, the headphones cost more than almost every other model in our ratings. The Maxes have transparency mode, to pipe in outside sound, as well as spatial audio capability. The biggest selling point for the Maxes is the distinct look and the premium feel you\u2019ve come to expect from an Apple product. And they provide the seamless compatibility with the company\u2019s other products that you get with all AirPods.\nThe AirPods Pro went for $169 during Amazon\u2019s October Prime Big Deal Days sale, so go ahead and pounce on these prices. These are Apple\u2019s bestselling earbuds, with good reason. They sound good and offer effective noise canceling, including a transparency mode that pipes in outside sound so that you\u2019re not fully cut off from the world while out walking. Better yet, says Apple, a free over-the-air upgrade now allows the model to deliver a clinical-grade hearing test, which can be used to turn them into over-the-counter hearing aids.\nThe Apple Watch SE is the company\u2019s budget model and it does everything most people want from a smartwatch\u2014and does it well. You can read and respond to texts, tap to pay at checkout, and get motivated to move by closing your daily activity rings.\nApple\u2019s entry-level iPad still provides the most bang for your buck, especially when you factor in the number of high-quality apps and services available for the iPad operating system. The model has a 10.9-inch display and 64 gigabytes of storage, and it records HD video. In our testing, the device delivers enough battery life for a cross-country flight or a day on the go.\nSmaller size and lighter weight make this iPad Mini easier to hold for extended periods than its larger brethren. The model has a bright, sharp display with a large viewing angle, meaning you don\u2019t need to hold it dead center in front of your face to see it clearly. The A15 Bionic chip is blazing fast, so web browsing and watching movies seem smooth and stutter-free. The battery life is impressive, too. Other features include a USB-C port and upgraded cameras.\nJust note that we\u2019ve seen this iPad selling for closer to $350 recently.\nMuch like trackers made by Samsung and Tile, Apple AirTags work best if it\u2019s within Bluetooth range (roughly 30 feet) of your own phone. But, that said, there are millions of iPhones and other Apple devices roaming around out there that can pick up a signal and discreetly convey it to you when you find yourself searching, say, a park or a school campus for the keys you dropped. Is the tracking pinpoint accurate? No. But it\u2019s close enough to give you a huge head start in your search.",
