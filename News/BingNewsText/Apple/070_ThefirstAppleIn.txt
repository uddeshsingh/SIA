    "maintext": "Apple Intelligence is finally here (sort of). With iOS 18.1, the first tranche set of AI features finally comes to our phones (albeit in beta and temporarily behind a waitlist).\nThe iPhone 16 line was sold as made for Apple Intelligence. It was Apple\u2019s big push at WWDC in the summer, and fancy AI-powered features are front-and-center in all the phone marketing. Camera Control button? Even that is just an AI-powered feature waiting for its true purpose.\n[ ]\nBut the first set of Apple Intelligence features is kind of\u2026feeble. I\u2019ve been using iOS 18.1 throughout its extended beta test, and there are only two really good AI features, with the rest being a mix of annoyances and \u201cuse it a few times and forget about it\u201d demonstrations.\nApple Intelligence: The good\nThere are two new AI features that I use daily and I think most people will make a part of their everyday iPhone use: Notification summaries and the Clean Up tool.\nThe new notification summaries capability can take almost any notification with more than a couple of lines of text and shorten it to fit in the notification. Text messages, social media posts, news alerts, email alerts\u2026 It turns out, most notifications are basically useless. They let you know something happened, but I\u2019ve become so accustomed to not really seeing the information I need that I just tap the notification and open the app to see what it says.\nWith notification summaries, I get an idea of what an alert is actually about, and it lets me know which notifications actually need my attention and which ones can wait. It\u2019s brilliant and fully intuitive. There\u2019s no learning curve; your notifications just instantly become much more useful.\nThe Clean Up tool in Photos, while not perfect, is a fun, fast, and easy way to play around with some light photo editing and can quickly improve a lot of impromptu shots. Unfortunately, Apple sort of hides it. You have to open a photo, tap the Edit button (which looks like a set of levers and is not entirely intuitive), and then press the Clean Up button. This is the kind of helpful feature that really deserves a top-level interface button!\nApple\nApple Intelligence: The bad\nThe suggested replies in Messages and Mail are routinely terrible. I can\u2019t remember the last time I actually opted to use one, and their glowing presence has become a total nuisance I wish I could easily disable.\nThe new Siri interface feels like a bad idea, too. I really love the new edge-lit glow and the way it washes over the screen (from the bottom if you say \u201cHey Siri\u201d and from the right side if you use the side button). But this new look is selling a new Siri that just doesn\u2019t exist.\nSiri is better about gracefully handling your \u201cum\u201ds and \u201cah\u201ds and mid-sentence corrections, but it\u2019s just as dumb as ever about answering requests. The real new Siri isn\u2019t coming until early next year when they roll out the personal contextual awareness, screen awareness, and overhauled App Intent system to work within apps.\nI get the impression iPhone users are going to complain that \u201cthe new Siri still sucks\u201d because they don\u2019t realize that the new Siri isn\u2019t here yet, just its facelift.\nApple Intelligence: The rest\nWriting tools aren\u2019t especially useful. I almost never found the need to select some text and change its tone or summarize it, and let\u2019s face it, nobody\u2019s going to proofread their emails or social media posts with this. It\u2019s kind of a neat tech demo, the sort of thing you use a few times just to say \u201ccool!\u201d and then hardly ever touch again. When people think of AI and text, they think of asking a question or giving a short prompt and getting paragraphs of original text as a reply, and this isn\u2019t that.\nFortunately, it\u2019s also hidden behind the text-selection interface so it\u2019s easy enough to ignore entirely. It won\u2019t get in your way.\nThe new natural Photos search works great and is really useful, but hardly a game-changer. Same with the new focus mode and summaries of call recordings and transcripts.\nApple Intelligence: Waiting for the good stuff\nWhen the general public thinks of \u201cAI\u201d today, they think of two things: long-form generative AI text, like having ChatGPT write your book report, and AI images.\nBut Apple Intelligence doesn\u2019t give you access to any of that yet. The generative image features (other than the Clean Up tool) have already made an appearance in the first iOS 18.2 beta and are expected to arrive later this year, including seamless integration with ChatGPT. The Camera Control button will also get its upgrade to summon \u201cVisual Intelligence\u201d in iOS 18.2 as well, making it more useful than the app launcher and shutter it is now.\nApple\nAnd of course, there\u2019s the long wait for the new Siri. Siri has been the poster child for AI since Apple bought the original Siri app and integrated it into the iPhone 4s 13 years ago. After years of not investing properly in advancing Siri\u2019s capabilities, it seems like Apple Intelligence is finally poised to give it a big boost, but we still have five or six months from getting that on our iPhone 16s.\nIn other words, our first taste of Apple Intelligence is a mixed bag at best, and it\u2019s going to be months before our new iPhone 16s do all the neat things shown in Apple\u2019s marketing.",
