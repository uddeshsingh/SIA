Fits laptops better and offers more protection than most similarly priced options. The stiff polyester fabric is a little more water-resistant than that of some of our other picks.\nOther things to know: Its front pocket, which barely holds a laptop charger, adds bulk. Surprisingly attractive but not particularly sleek or refined. Deal price is for the black sleeves that fit a 14-inch MacBook Pro; other on-sale colors are slightly higher.\nRead more: The Best Laptop Sleeves and MacBook Cases\nApple Pencil (1st Generation) \u2014 Top Pick\nWalmart deal price: $60; street price: $100\nAmazon deal price: $60; street price: $100\nWhat we like: The best stylus for drawing on entry-level iPads.

Logi Options+ software required to customize its buttons and sensitivity. A couple of bucks higher than what we saw during Prime Day but still a good deal.\nRead more: The Best Wireless Mouse\nKate Spade Pav\u00e9 Scallop Link Apple Watch Band \u2014 Top Pick\nAmazon deal price: $70; street price: $100\nWhat we like: A stainless steel version of our favorite Apple Watch jewelry band.

Comfortable design with backlit keys and good tactile feedback. Case separates from keyboard to protect iPad when you\u2019re not typing. Two viewing angles.

Supports MagSafe for wireless charging and attaching accessories.\nOther things to know: Doesn\u2019t provide the best grip and can\u2019t protect your phone much against drops.

Holds up to three cards firmly without sacrificing design or Camera Control access. Soft, rubberlike TPU construction, with air pockets in the corners, pebble-textured sides for grip, and rubber interior.\nOther things to know: Not MagSafe compatible, so you\u2019ll need to switch cases to use wireless charging or magnetic accessories. Thicker profile than traditional cases. Not the best deal we've seen, but still a good deal price. Deal on black and blue.\nRead more: The Best iPhone Cases\nSmartish Gripzilla with MagSafe for iPhone 16 Case \u2014 Top Pick\nAmazon deal price: $23; street price: $30\nWhat we like: Our top more protective case pick for the iPhone 16. Basically the Smartish Gripmunk but slightly thicker. Added air pocket corners offer even greater shock absorption. More deeply recessed finger ridges on either side to create an especially secure grip. MagSafe support is built in.\nOther things to know: The larger corners give it a little more bulk, which tends to be the trade-off with a more protective case. Clip the on-page coupon.
