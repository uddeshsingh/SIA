    "maintext": "Table of Contents\nUPDATE: Dec. 2, 2024, 5:45 p.m. EST This story has been updated with a handful of new deals, including several Keurigs and two super affordable Shark robot vacuums left over from Black Friday.\nThe best Cyber Monday deals at Walmart:\nWalmart is tying a bow on its 2024 holiday programming with an extended Cyber Monday sale. After kicking off at 8 p.m. ET on Sunday, Dec. 1 (following three hours of early access for paid Walmart+ members), the sitewide savings event is now live through 11:59 p.m. ET on Monday, Dec. 2.\nThe big-box store's sale features lingering deals from its Black Friday event last week, including $154 Apple AirPods Pro 2, $29 JLab ANC headphones, a $178 55-inch 4K TV, and $30 digital copies of The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom. They're joined a handful of new discounts on large 4K TVs, gaming laptops, and Lego sets. All offers are available online while supplies last.\nAnnual Walmart+ memberships are also 50% off through the end of the day, which is low-key a great streaming deal. (The subscription service comes with a free year's worth of Paramount+ Essential valued at $59.99/year.)\nMashable's team of deal-hunting pros knows how to distinguish good discounts from duds, having covered Cyber Weekend sales for nearly a decade, and we're keeping a running list of Walmart's top holiday deals on popular tech and gifts this season. Keep scrolling to see our picks, and check back often: Walmart is dropping additional deals randomly during its holiday sales this year.\nA quick FYI that Walmart doesn't do price matches, but its extended return/exchange policy is in effect through Dec. 31. It covers most items purchased in stores and online.\nNote: All newly added or updated deals have been marked with a \u2728, while struck-through deals were sold out at the time of writing.\nBest Apple Deal\nWhy we like it\nRead Mashable's full review of the Apple AirPods Pro 2.\nApple's second-generation ANC earbuds have an Adaptive Transparency mode that lets the user hear environmental sounds while reducing loud noises, and \u2014 as this fall \u2014 a new clinical-grade Hearing Aid feature. Our reviewer was impressed by their \"great sound\" and a \"long-lasting battery life,\" and appreciated the fact that they retained the same \"really comfortable\" fit as their predecessors. You don't need to upgrade if you already own the original AirPods Pro, but they're a nice upgrade from the non-Pro version.\nWalmart has been a trendsetter this Cyber Weekend: After it dropped the AirPods Pro 2 down to a record-low of $154 during its second Black Friday deals event (normally $249), other retailers like Amazon and Target swiftly followed suit. Only the former's deal was still live at the time of writing.\nMore Apple deals at Walmart\nAirPods\nApple AirPods (2nd Gen) \u2014 $89 $129 (save $40)\niPads\nApple iPad, 10.9-inch (A14 Bionic, WiFi, 64GB SSD) \u2014 $259 $349 (save $90)\nMacBooks\nApple MacBook Air, 13-inch (M1, 8GB RAM, 256GB SSD) \u2014 $599\nApple Watch\nApple Watch SE, 2nd Gen (40mm, GPS) \u2014 $149 $249 (save $100)\nApple Watch Series 10 (42mm, GPS) \u2014 $329 $399 (save $70)\nApple Watch Series 10 (46mm, GPS) \u2014 $359 $429 (save $70)\nApple accessories\nApple 20W USB-C Power Adapter \u2014 $9 $19 (save $10)\nApple Pencil (1st Gen) \u2014 $59 $99 (save $40)\nApple AirTags (4-pack) \u2014 $72.99 $99 (save $26.01)\niPhone cases\nOtterBox Defender Series Pro Case for MagSafe (Apple iPhone 16) \u2014 $19 $64.95 (save $45.95)\nOtterBox Defender Series Pro Case for MagSafe (Apple iPhone 16 Plus) \u2014 $19 $64.95 (save $45.95)\nOtterBox Defender Series Pro Case for MagSafe (Apple iPhone 16 Pro) \u2014 $19 $64.95 (save $45.95)\nOtterBox Defender Series Pro Case for MagSafe (Apple iPhone 16 Pro Max) \u2014 $19 $64.95 (save $45.95)\nOtterBox Defender Series Pro Case (Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max) \u2014 $19 $64.95 (save $45.95)\nOtterBox Defender Series Pro Case (Apple iPhone 15/14/13) \u2014 $19 $64.95 (save $45.95)\nOtterBox Defender Series Pro Case (Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max) \u2014 $19 $64.95 (save $45.95)\nOtterBox Defender Series Pro Case (Apple iPhone 13 Pro Max/12 Pro Max) \u2014 $19 $64.95 (save $45.95)\nOtterBox Defender Series Pro Case (Apple iPhone 12/12 Pro) \u2014 $19 $64.95 (save $45.95)\nOtterBox Defender Series Pro Case (Apple iPhone 11) \u2014 $19 $64.95 (save $45.95)\nBest TV deal\nWhy we like it\nWalmart is famous for its Cyber Weekend TV doorbusters, and this year the big-box store went hard. So hard, in fact, that Walmart has had a hard time keeping its most headline-worthy drops in stock \u2014 but we found a good one that's still available. If you missed the $178 55-inch Hisense Roku TV that's sold out, consider bumping up to the brighter, more colorful version of that TV: a 55-inch QLED for $288.\nBest Buy's cheaper QLED model is a Google TV, so the one you ultimately add to your cart will come down to availability and/or your smart TV platform preference. At any rate, a mid-size QLED from a recognizable brand like Hisense for under $300 is a steal \u2014 and a must-have for the rest of football season.\nMore TV deals at Walmart\nonn. 43-inch LED Roku TV \u2014 $94 (Special Buy)\nPhilips 50-inch 7600 4K Google Gaming TV \u2014 $298 $399.99 (save $101.99) \u2728\nSamsung 55-inch DU6900 4K TV \u2014 $298 $349.99 (save $51.99)\nHisense 58-inch R6 4K Roku TV \u2014 $248 $298 (save $50)\nTCL 65-inch S4 4K Roku TV \u2014 $228 $378 (save $150)\nHisense 65-inch U6HR QLED 4K Roku TV \u2014 $378 $498 (save $120)\nSamsung 65-inch DU6900 4K TV \u2014 $398 $469.99 (save $71.99)\nVizio 75-inch 4K Smart TV \u2014 $478 $598 (save $120)\nHisense 75-inch U6H ULED 4K Google TV \u2014 $498 $698 (save $200) \u2728\nSony 75-inch X85K 4K Google TV \u2014 $898 $1,299.99 (save $401.99) \u2728\nSony 75-inch Bravia XR X93L 4K Mini LED Google TV \u2014 $1,498 $2,498 (save $1,000)\nHisense 85-inch R6 4K Roku TV \u2014 $548 $798 (save $250)\nBest gaming deal\nWhy we like it\nRead Mashable's full review of The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom.\nThe stunning sequel to Breath of the Wild was one of Mashable's favorite games of 2023, and it's never been this cheap before. It actually sold out once at this price last week during Walmart's Black Friday Deals event; it was back in stock at the time of writing. Note that the deal only applies to the digital version of the game, so you won't have anything to wrap, but you (or a giftee) can start playing it immediately.\nMore gaming deals at Walmart\nVideo games\nBluey: The Videogame \u2014 $30 $39.99 (save $9.99)\nCollege Football 25 \u2014 $30 $69.99 (save $39.99)\nEA Sports FC 25 \u2014 $30 $69.99 (save $39.99)\nMadden NFL 25 \u2014 $30 $69.99 (save $39.99)\nNBA 2K25 \u2014 $30 $69.99 (save $39.99)\nMarvel's Spider-Man 2 \u2014 $30 $69.99 (save $39.99)\nSuper Mario: Odyssey \u2014 $30 $59.99 (save $29.99)\nGaming consoles and bundles\nMy Arcacde Atari GameStation Pro \u2014 $69 $99.99 (save $30.99)\nXbox Series S (512GB) \u2014 $248 $299.99 (save $51.99)\nNintendo Switch Mario Kart 8 Deluxe Bundle \u2014 $249 $299 (save $50)\nNintendo Switch OLED Model Mario Kart 8 Deluxe Bundle \u2014 $299 $349 (save $50)\nXbox Series X (1TB Digital Edition) \u2014 $398 $449.99 (save $51.99)\nPlayStation VR 2 Horizon Call of The Mountain Bundle \u2014 $349 $599.99 (save $250.99)\nPlayStation 5 Slim Digital Edition Fortnite Cobalt Star Bundle \u2014 $374 $449.99 (save $75.99)\nPlayStation 5 Slim Fortnite Cobalt Star Bundle \u2014 $424 $499.99 (save $75.99)\nGaming controllers\nPowerA Enhanced Wireless Controller for Nintendo Switch \u2014 $35 $59.99 (save $24.99)\nPowerA Enhanced Wireless Controller for Nintendo Switch (Color Splash Heroes) \u2014 $35 $59.99 (save $24.99)\nNintendo Switch Pro Controller \u2014 $49 $69.99 (save $20.99)\nDualSense Wireless Controller \u2014 $54 $74.99 (save $20.99)\nNintendo Switch Joy-Con (Neon Red/Neon Blue) \u2014 $59 $79.99 (save $20.99)\nBackbone One PlayStation Edition (Lightning/2nd Gen) \u2014 $69 $99.99 (save $30.99)\nAsus ROG Raikiri \u2014 $79.99 $99.99 (save $20)\nGaming laptops\nAcer Nitro V 15 (Intel Core i5-13420H, Nvidia GeForce RTX 4050, 16GB RAM 512GB SSD) \u2014 $599 $799 (save $200) + free copy of Assassin's Creed Shadows\nLenovo Legion 5i (Intel Core i7-13650HX, Nvidia GeForce RTX 4060, 16GB RAM, 1TB SSD) \u2014 $879 $1,299.99 (save $420.99) + free copy of Assassin's Creed Shadows\nAsus ROG Strix G17 (AMD Ryzen 9-7845HX, Nvidia GeForce RTX 4070, 16GB RAM, 1TB SSD) \u2014 $1,199 $1,599 (save $400)\nGaming headsets\nTurtle Beach Recon 70 \u2014 $20 $39.99 (save $19.99)\nTurtle Beach Stealth 700 (Gen 3) \u2014 $149.99 $199.99 (save $50) \u2728\nGaming monitors\nMashable Deals\nWant more hand-picked deals from our shopping experts?\nSign up for the Mashable Deals newsletter.\nBy signing up you agree to our Terms of Use and Privacy Policy.\nThanks for signing up!\nAcer 27-inch 180Hz Curved Gaming Monitor \u2014 $109 $169.99 (save $60.99)\nAcer 31.5-inch Nitro 180Hz Curved Gaming Monitor \u2014 $129 $199.99 (save $70.99)\nBest headphone/earbud deal\nWhy we like it\nOur initial reaction to seeing this deal was, \"Is this allowed? \" Twenty-nine bucks is a surprisingly and stupidly low price on a solid pair of comfy budget headphones with good noise cancellation and a long battery life. (JLab has rated them at up to 70 hours; we're currently testing them and feel like that's accurate.) Elsewhere, the JBuds Lux ANC are going for $46.99 at Amazon and $49.99 on the JLab website, so no idea how Walmart finagled this one.\nMore headphone/earbud deals at Walmart\nEarbuds\nJLab Go Air Pop
