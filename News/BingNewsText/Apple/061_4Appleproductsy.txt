    "maintext": "It seems that Apple Intelligence is driving the latest wave of Apple hardware upgrades, and last week, we saw a new iMac and Mac mini revealed. These join the new iPad Mini, the iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Pro lineup, the Apple Watch Series 10, and new AirPods 4 -- so much to drool over -- not to mention buy!\nAlso: How Apple Watch helped me hit a hole-in-one on the golf course\nApple Intelligence -- technology that leverages the processing power of Apple silicon to understand and generate language, providing personalized assistance and insights -- is the perfect tool for Apple to use to showcase the power of its hardware.\nHowever, in an interesting turn of events, rather than updating the Apple Watch Ultra 2 and the AirPods Pro, Apple has given this hardware a new lease on life by adding new features such as sleep apnea detection for the Ultra 2 and a clinical hearing aid feature for the AirPods Pro.\nAlso: Every iPhone model that will be updated to Apple's iOS 18 (and which ones won't)\nThat leaves some spare money to buy one of those titanium Milanese bands for your Apple Watch Ultra 2.\nThe 'Naughty' list\nGive these devices a hard pass:\n14-/16-inch MacBook Pro: Coming up on a year old now, so there's likely an upgrade on the way soon.\niPhone SE: Apple released this handset in March 2022, and rumor has it that there won't be another one. Other rumors say it should have been this year, while others say it should be sometime in 2025. We'll see.\nMac Studio: The M2-powered Mac Studio is no longer the beast it was, and given that it's over a year old and running on previous-generation silicon, I suggest giving it a miss.\nApple TV: Last updated in October 2022, this device is due for a refresh, possibly alongside the iPhone, so unless you desperately need a new one, wait a few months.\nThe 'Nice' list\n1. Apple iMac\nThe iMac gets a refresh to bring it up to speed with Apple Intelligence. With specs ranging from 8 CPU and GPU cores, 16GB of RAM, and 256GB of storage priced at $1,299, all the way up to 10 CPU and GPU cores, 24GB of RAM, and 512GB of storage for $1,899, there's a iMac to suit most workloads and budgets.\n2. Apple Mac Mini\nApple smallest Mac gets an upgrade to the M4 and M4 Pro processors. And it's also the cheapest Mac you can buy, as a Mac Mini with the 10-Core CPU and GPU model with 16GB of RAM and 256GB of storage costing only $599.\n3. Apple iPad Mini\nThe all-new 2024 iPad Mini replaces the three-year-old model with one powered by an A17 Pro chip that's Apple Intelligence ready, and comes in a range of colors (blue, purple, starlight, and space grey) and storage capacities (128GB, 256GB, and 512GB) to suit everyone. Prices range from $499 to $799.\n4. Apple iPhone 16\nFrom a Camera Control button, an Action button, and the new A18 chipset, the iPhone 16 has been built from the ground up to handle AI workloads.\n5. Apple Watch Series 10\nThe Apple Watch Series 10 starts at $399 for GPS and $499 for cellular. It comes in three colors: jet black, rose gold, and silver aluminum. The new black Apple Watch Ultra 2 starts at $799.\n6. Apple M3 MacBook Air\nApple's MacBook Air has an M3 chip -- more oomph to tackle heavier-duty AI tasks.\nReview: M3 MacBook Air: Apple's AI computer for the masses has arrived\nAlong with the updated processor, this MacBook Air can also power two external monitors with the lid closed, making it a great desktop replacement -- just add two screens!\nWith prices for the 13-inch M3 MacBook Air starting at $1,099, and the 15-inch version starting at $200 more, these systems represent some serious processing power for an extremely competitive price (especially when you consider these are Apple laptops).\n7. Apple Vision Pro\nApple's newest product is the company's foray into mixed-reality spatial computing.\nAlso: 10 reasons the Apple Vision Pro is secretly brilliant\nIt's hard to bet against Apple, but a futuristic set of goggles with a starting price of $3,499 doesn't feel like the easiest thing to sell. Still, Apple is Apple, and if any company can convince consumers to part with large sums of cash (and developers to create apps for a new platform that could fall flat on its face), it's Apple.\n8. 2nd-gen AirPods Pro (now with USB-C)\nThe AirPods Pro (2nd Gen) offers a major upgrade over the previous model, giving Apple's premium buds a massive lead over the competition. Apple has now refreshed the charging case to use USB-C rather than Lightning -- great if you have a new iPhone, but yet another cable or dongle to carry if not. Here are the highlights:\nActive Noise Cancellation reduces unwanted background noise.\nAdaptive Transparency lets outside sounds in while reducing loud environmental noise.\nPersonalized Spatial Audio with dynamic head tracking places the sound all around you.\nMultiple ear tips are included (XS, S, M, L).\nTouch control lets you swipe to adjust volume, press to direct media playback, answer or end calls, and press and hold to switch between listening modes.\nSweat- and water-resistant for AirPods Pro and charging case.\nMagSafe Charging Case has a speaker and a lanyard loop.\nUSB-C charging.\nAlso: Apple AirPods Pro (2nd Gen) review: Two major upgrades, tamed by one familiar flaw\nAnd now with the release of iOS 18.1, your AirPods Pro earbuds can function as clinical-grade hearing aids, bringing better hearing to tens of millions of people, and disrupting the lucrative hearing aids market.\n9. Apple AirTag\nApple's AirTags are the perfect gift for someone who constantly loses things. You can add them to your luggage, attach them to your bike, your remote, or even your moving boxes -- the possibilities are endless.\nAlso: How to find out if an AirTag is tracking you\nWell-made, robust, and with a replaceable battery, these will make misplaced keys or lost wallet things of the past.",
