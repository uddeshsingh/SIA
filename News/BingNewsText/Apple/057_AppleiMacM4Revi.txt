    "maintext": "Apple\u2019s desktop computer, the iMac, has just been re-released with an upgraded processor, new colors and more. The memory in the entry-level version has doubled, from 8GB to 16GB, though with the same price, $1,299. I\u2019ve been testing the new iMac since just after Apple announced it at the end of October. So, should you buy one? Read on for all that\u2019s new, how it works and whether it\u2019s worth it.\nApple iMac M4: Design\nThere are some subtle changes to how the new iMac looks. First, there are the new colors. As well as silver, the iMac comes in green, yellow, orange, pink, purple and blue finishes. If that sounds like the exact range from previous years, you\u2019re right but this time every single color has been gently updated.\nForbesiPhone 17 Long-Awaited Design Upgrade Coming, New Leak Claims\nI\u2019ve been testing the yellow version, which has an understated, subtler hue than before. The anodized finish on the rear of the iMac is slightly more pale yellow and less golden than it was before. The yellow front panel that sits below the display is also more lemon and less egg-yolk. There\u2019s a fresher feel to the colors this time around, with a little more punch, especially on the back of the iMac. Apple also color-matches the accessories such as mouse, keyboard and trackpad, even down to the charging cable.\nThere\u2019s another change: last time around you could only snag a yellow, orange or purple finish if you chose the iMac with the faster version of the chip. This time, Apple has made it more democratic, and every color is available even in the entry level.\nAnd here is another design update that\u2019s subtle but which everyone, and I mean everyone, will applaud. The connector on the accessories has now been changed from lightning to USB-C. While this isn\u2019t the step-change in convenience that it was on the iPhone because you likely have a Lightning cable attached to the back of the iMac anyway, it\u2019s a definite move forward.\nIf you\u2019re one of those people who\u2019s been waiting for Apple to update the charging arrangement for the Magic Mouse so you don\u2019t have to flip it on its back like a turtle to charge it, I\u2019m afraid there\u2019s no change here.\nThe color-coding doesn\u2019t stop at the hardware, by the way. As well as the peripherals being matched to the hue of the iMac, so is the wallpaper on screen. You can change this, of course, but Apple has drilled color so deeply into these devices that even when you highlight text, the shade matches your iMac.\nThere are no other visible differences between the new iMac and last year\u2019s model, although the front-facing camera is a different component, now called the Center Stage camera.\nThis comes with a feature called Desk View, which means you can show your physical desktop as well as what\u2019s on screen to people at the other end of the call. This works very well. The camera is excellent and where some people had previously complained that video call quality was subpar, here it seems pristine, clear and highly watchable.\nApple iMac M4: Display\nThe new iMac comes with a 24-inch display that\u2019s identical to the last generation. The resolution is 4480 x 2520, which gives 218 pixels per inch resolution. When I had moved from a 27-inch iMac to a 24-inch display, I thought I would miss the extra real estate. I never have, and this display is easily big enough for all my needs. Your mileage may vary.\nThere is one visual change that wasn\u2019t on the last 24-inch iMac, and that\u2019s the option for a nano-texture finish. This is the subtle, more matte look that has previously been seen on the 27-inch iMac. It\u2019s now on the new MacBook Pro with M4 processor that has just arrived. Here, it\u2019s only available if you choose the iMac with the faster, 10-core M for processor.\nIt costs an extra $150, and not everyone needs it, but it looks beautiful, with far fewer reflections or glare.\nApple iMac M4: Performance\nThe new iMac has the Apple M4 chip at its heart, a step up from last year\u2019s M3 version. To be clear, the M3 iMac, which I\u2019ve been using until now, has always been fast and capable and I\u2019ve never known it to slow down or be glitchy. But, for sure, this is faster.\nOne of the reasons for this is Apple Intelligence, which has just been released with macOS Sequoia 15.1. While Apple says that all Mac computers with Apple processors from the M1 onwards are compatible with Apple Intelligence, it feels super-fast here. And the arrival of Apple Intelligence may have contributed to Apple upgrading the entry-level RAM from 8 GB to 16 GB to ensure the smoothest experience.\nPerformance has also been improved by the introduction of Thunderbolt 4 ports. Now all the rear sockets on the iMac are Thunderbolt 4 with 40Gbps data transfer speeds. You can choose between two or four ports, but note that you need the faster chip to get four ports.\nThat faster chip has a 10-core CPU and 10-core GPU but is otherwise identical to the entry level M4 processor. It is fast and efficient, keeping up with everything you throw at it.\nIn case you\u2019re one of those people upgrading from an Intel iMac, this one is up to six times faster.\nApple iMac M4: Verdict\nThe iMac colors are spicier this year, but otherwise things look near-identical to last year\u2019s model. But you get double the RAM for your money on the entry-level model, faster Thunderbolt 4 connections and, most meaningful of all, the super-fast M4 processor. The speeds of the M4 are easily enough for most, and Apple Intelligence runs like a dream.\nThe switch to USB-C for the accessories may have come later than one would have liked, but it\u2019s a very welcome upgrade now.\nThere\u2019s no option to chip up to M4 Pro, but that doesn\u2019t matter: this is a general-use device and it remains the most attractive, approachable and delightful all-in-one around.",
