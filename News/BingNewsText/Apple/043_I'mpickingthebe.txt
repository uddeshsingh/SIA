You just need to remember to click the \"Show me options for this offer next\" checkbox before moving on from the first page.\nFrom there, you'll find the options for a 10th-gen iPad, Apple Watch Series 10 or Apple Watch SE 2nd gen. However, just know that these extra devices will require data service added on to your phone plan.\niPhone 16 Pro: Free with trade-in @ AT&T\nLike Verizon, AT&T is offering an iPhone 16 Pro for free, though you need to trade-in your current device to qualify for the offer. With your trade-in, you'll get up to $1,000 back in the form of bill credits spread out over 36 months. You also need to sign up for an unlimited data plan with the carrier. Additionally, you can tack on an Apple Watch and iPad for 99 cents/month each, provided you include those devices with your wireless plan. Finally, if you're ordering online and activating a new line at AT&T, the wireless carrier will give you $200 off in the form of monthly bill credits.\nApple iPhone 16 Pro Max: get a $250 gift card @ Visible Visible has one of the cheapest unlimited cell phone plans around. I've been a customer for years now because of their low-cost wireless plans, but this Cyber Monday iPhone deal comes bundled with a $250 gift card, which you can in turn use on the service (or on a future phone purchase).\nApple iPhone 16 Pro Max: $5 per month @ Verizon\nNot only is Verizon offering the iPhone 16 Pro for free, but you also get the Pro Max for $5 per month if you want to go big with the top-of-the-line iPhone model. By signing up for the company's most expensive unlimited plan \u2014 Unlimited Ultimate, which costs $90/month \u2014 they'll take a ton of money off the price of the best iPhone you can buy, with your discount coming in the form of bill credits over the next 36 months.\niPhone 16 Pro: Free @ Xfinity Mobile\nXfinity Mobile is a compelling option for your wireless service if you already get your home internet service from Comcast. And right now, the carrier is offering a free iPhone 16 Pro when you trade in a qualifying device (an iPhone 13 or later will do the trick) and sign up for Xfinity's Unlimited Plus plan on a new line. That plan costs $50 a month, which is $10 more than Xfinity's standard unlimited plan. Xfinity uses Verizon's network for its coverage, including 5G. This deal expires December 3.\nApple iPhone 16 Pro: $100 gift card with purchase @ Best Buy\nYou can get bigger discounts if you need a contract with your new iPhone, but if you just want the device, Best Buy will give you a flat $100 gift card upon delivery or pick-up of your new iPhone 16 Pro.\nApple iPhone 16: $100 gift card with purchase @ Best Buy\nAs with the Pro iPhone deal above, you get a $100 gift card when you buy the iPhone 16 from Best Buy - no questions asked.\niPhone 16: for $0.01 + $65/month with Unlimited @ Amazon\nAmazon is offering any iPhone 16 model for just $0.01 when you purchase it with a Boost Infinite plan. Boost Infinite is a membership plan for iPhone users. From $65/month, you get unlimited talk, text, and 5G data. Plus, you'll get a free iPhone 16. After 12 consecutive monthly payments, members can upgrade to the latest iPhone model at no extra cost. There is no trade-in requirement to join, which means you can keep your current iPhone or sell it to a third party.\niPhone 16 Plus: free with no trade in @ Verizon I've said it before, I'll say it again. You don't have to trade in your existing phone to get a good deal on an iPhone. Take Verizon for example, which is making the iPhone 16 Plus for free when you start a new line and commit to 36 months of service. This new model has an incredible dual camera system that takes outstanding photos, while also having access to new Apple Intelligence features.\niPhone 15: $5.99/month @ AT&T At the rate of $5.99/month, you'll end up paying a total of $215.64 over the course of 36 months for the an iPhone 15 with AT&T. Why's this an excellent deal? Well, that's because the carrier isn't forcing a trade-in to snag this offer. Just add the iPhone 15 to your cart and it'll automatically go down to $5.99/month. You could pay $799 for the newer iPhone 16, but I think an iPhone 15 for $215 is an incredible offer, even if that model doesn't support Apple Intelligence features.\nApple iPhone 14: $11/month with Verizon/AT&T plan @ Walmart Sure it's a couple of generations old at this point, but Walmart's deal on the iPhone 14 is hard to pass up on because it will only cost you $11/months for 36 months. That turns out to be under $400 for an iPhone that originally sold for $700 when it first launched. I still ike the iPhone 14's smaller size and the snappy performance of its A15 Bionic chip, though you will miss out on Apple Intelligence features with this iPhone.\nApple iPhone SE (2022): was $429 now $179 @ Best Buy Although it's long overdue for an upgrade, the iPhone SE (2022) still has a lot to offer if you prefer an iPhone that's small in both price and size. You can get the iPhone SE at the amazing cost of $179 with Total by Verizon, which can be unlocked in 60 days after activation. Just be aware that we're expecting to see the iPhone SE 4 in spring 2025.\nPrice check: $179 @ Walmart\niPhone 12: was $629 now $49 @ Cricket Wireless Cricket Wireless offers a pretty affordable unlimited wireless plan, which pairs nicely with its iPhone 12 deal. You'll only need to commit to porting in your number and paying $60/month for two months of Cricket's unlimited plan to get the iPhone 12's price down to $49. One nice bonus to that Cricket plan: it includes a free subscription to the ad-supported tier of the Max streaming service, something you won't find at a lot of other carriers.\niPhone 13: was $399 now $199 @ Straight Talk Straight Talk has a decent deal on the iPhone 13, normally $449. The iPhone 13 is a few years old at this point, but it still supports the latest version of Apple's phone software \u2014 iOS 18\u2014 it just won't be able to use the Apple Intelligence features. There's also an additional $200 off when you activate a line of service on a Silver Unlimited plan or higher.\niPhone SE: free w/ unlimited + new line @ Verizon\nNew and existing members can get an iPhone SE for free when you open a new unlimited line. That's $429 off and one of the best Verizon deals we've seen. (No trade-in is required for this deal). In our iPhone SE review we said it delivers best-in-class performance and great photos for an affordable price, if you can live with a small screen. It's powered by Apple's A15 Bionic chip. Other features include a 4.7-inch Retina HD display (1334 x 750), Touch ID support, 12MP wide/rear camera, 7MP FaceTime camera, 5G connectivity and up to 15-hour battery life.\nAirPods deals\nApple AirPods Pro 2: was $249 now $154 at Amazon\nI use my AirPods Pro 2 as my daily earbuds for music and video calls and I love them. There's a lot to like between the stellar sound quality and strong noise cancelation. The hearing aid feature is here, too, adding yet another reason to grab these. And at $154, the AirPods Pro 2 are only $0.01 off their lowest-ever price ($153.99).\nApple AirPods 3: was $179 now $169 at Walmart\nThe redesigned AirPods (3rd gen) are powered by the Apple H1 chip and feature spatial audio technology, Adaptive EQ, sweat- and water-resistance, and a battery life of up to 6 hours (which extends to 30 hours with the charging case). This deal brings Apple's earbuds down to the lowest price we've ever seen.\nApple AirPods 4: was $129 now $119 at Amazon\nLOWEST PRICE! The AirPods 4 boast a new design, which Apple has refined with \"50 million data points\" to create the most comfortable AirPods ever. They also feature Apple's H2 chip, which delivers clearer calls with Voice Isolation, and a new, hands-free way to interact with Siri. The AirPods 4 also have USB-C charging and include up to 30 hours of listening time. In our AirPods 4 review, we said the Editor's Choice earbuds bring Apple's wireless earbuds lineup into the modern day with Pro-level features for less.\nPrice check: $129 @ Best Buy\nApple AirPods 4 w/ ANC: was $179 now $164 at Amazon\nLOWEST PRICE!

They also feature Adaptive Audio, Transparency mode, and Voice Isolation.\nApple AirPods Max (Lightning): was $549 now $399 at Amazon\nApple's AirPods Max are the top-of-the-line headphones offered in the AirPods category. We loved the stunning sound quality and top-notch ANC in our AirPods Max review, where they earned a 4-star rating. They're also incredibly comfortable thanks to the mesh headband, and the controls are some of the easiest to use around. This $150 discount brings them down to their lowest price ever\niPad deals\nApple 20W USC-C power adapter: was $19 now $14 at Best Buy\nYou don't see first-party Apple chargers and accessories discounted too often. However, right now, you can get Apple's 20W USB-C power adapter for $5 off the regular price right now at Best Buy. You can never have too many power bricks floating around, especially when they're ones made by Apple.\nApple Magic Keyboard for iPad: was $299 now $224 at Amazon\nIf you're looking for the perfect accessory to go with your new iPad, look no further than the iPad Magic Keyboard. In our iPad Magic Keyboard review, we loved the responsive trackpad and how easy it was to type on. With the keyboard, you can practically transform your iPad into a laptop. This keyboard is compatible with iPad Pro 11-inch (1st-4th gen) generation), iPad Air (4th and 5th gen), iPad Air (5th generation), and iPad Air 11-inch (M2).\nApple 10.2\" iPad (Wi-Fi/64GB): was $329 now $199 at Target\nLOWEST PRICE! Yes it's an older model from 2021, but the iPad 9th Gen at $199 for Cyber Monday is one of the best deals because it functionally can do the same things as the newer 10th Gen model. Plus, it runs the same iPad OS 18 software just like all the other newer iPads.\nApple 10.9\" iPad (Wi-Fi/64GB): was $349 now $279 at Amazon\nIt's funny how time changes things.
