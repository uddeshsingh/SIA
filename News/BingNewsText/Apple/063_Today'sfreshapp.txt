    "maintext": "Today's apples don't grow on towering trees, could have been picked in 2023, and taste way different than they used to.\nAnd that's just the beginning of the surprising modern reality of a quintessentially American fruit \u2012 one that captures our imagination each fall with apple-picking, apple cider doughnuts and apple pie.\nToday's juicy Honeycrisps, sweet Fujis, crunchy SweeTangos or tart-ish Pink Ladies are the product of bewildering scientific and agricultural innovations. Orchards of today \u2012 filled with short, trellised trees harvested by people on self-driving platforms or sometimes even robots \u2012 sound like the stuff of science fiction.\nBut apple fundamentals have stayed the same. Apples remain a healthy, nutritious snack, low in calories, high in fiber and vitamin C. Eat them peel-on to get the most of their fiber and antioxidants.\nUSA TODAY spoke with apple breeders, growers, packers and researchers to find out the secrets of one of America's most popular fruits. Here's what we learned:\nApple orchards look more like vineyards than forests\nA modern apple orchard looks nothing like the towering, pink blossomed trees of story books. And Johnny Appleseed would find no takers for his offerings.\n\u201cThe thing most people find surprising is just what the orchards look like,\u201d said Amanda Van Lanen, a history professor at Lewis-Clark State College in Lewiston, Idaho, and author of \u201cThe Washington Apple: Orchards and the Development of Industrial Agriculture.\u201d\n\u201cYou say \u2018orchard\u2019 and people have this pastoral orchard in their head.\u201d\nModern apples are not grown from seeds but from scions (buds) grafted onto semi-dwarf or dwarf rootstock from disease-resistant strains. The trees grow to only 10 to 11 feet tall. As many as 1,300 to 1,500 can be planted per acre.\nThe trees are also trained to grow along wire trellises. That's in part to protect them from falling over in a severe windstorm, said Dave Gleason, a horticulturist in Washington state whose been working with apples since the 1960s.\nThe shift to this kind of shaping began in the late 1970s, in part to allow easier pruning and picking, he said.\nApple picking has gone high-tech\nFall revelers may pay a premium to wander orchards to handpick apples, but that's not how the pros do it anymore.\n\u201cBack in the day you had to know how to climb down a 14-foot ladder with a 40- to 50-pound bag of apples and not bruise or hurt the fruit,\u201d Gleason said.\n\u201cLabor is now 75% of our costs,\u201d he said, and finding experienced pickers to keep fruit in good shape is harder every year.\nToday, many orchards use self-driving harvest-assist platforms that slowly drive down the rows. Arms on either side reach out to touch the trees on either side to keep it in the center, Gleason said. \"The people just fill their bag and put it in the bin. It simplifies things,\" he said.\nIn late October, he attended a demonstration of a robotic apple picker that could pluck 4,000 pieces of fruit an hour. A good human picker can do about 2,000.\nGrocery stores only recently started stocking a variety of apples\nNot so long ago, most American supermarkets sold only a few apple varieties \u2013 Red Delicious, Golden Delicious and Granny Smiths.\n\u201cIt was red, yellow and green. That was it,\u201d said Carolina Torres, a professor and chair in tree fruit post harvest technology at Washington State University.\nBut apples have a long history of being far more diverse than that. At one time, the U.S. boasted as many as 17,000 apple varieties, according to \"The Illustrated History of Apples in the United States and Canada.\" Those were mostly grown and sold locally.\nIt was only in the 1980s that more apple varieties began to be consistently available nationwide. The Granny Smith from Australia and the Gala from New Zealand became available in the 1970s. The Fuji, from Japan, arrived in the 1980s. Then the Honeycrisp from Minnesota and the Pink Lady (also known as a Cripps Pink) from Australia hit like rock star apples in the 1990s.\nMore:How many varieties of apples are there? A visual guide to apple-picking season\n\u201cBut the abundance of apple varieties that grace most supermarkets only came about after 2010,\u201d Van Lanen said.\nA trip to even an average American supermarket today is likely to turn up many new varieties, such as Cosmic Crisp, SnapDragon, Opal, Ruby Frost, SweeTango, Sonata, Jazz and Envy.\n\u201cIt\u2019s really in the last 20 years that we started to see the explosion of different varieties,\u201d she said.\nOne state dominates the apple business\nWashington state produces 68% of the apples grown in the United States, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. It dominates in part because because the state's dry eastern portion has an excellent climate for the fruit.\n\u201cWe have very low humidity because we\u2019re irrigated desert,\u201d said Kate Evans, a professor of horticulture in the Washington State University Tree Fruit Research & Extension Center. \u201cBecause of that we don\u2019t have the problems that many production areas have, which is particularly important for fungal diseases.\u201d\nThe area also has excellent apple growing weather, cold winters to give trees a winter chilling period (essential to the formation of flower buds), then sunny summers and falls.\n\u201cThe differential in the temperature between day and night as we hit the end of summer and into fall stimulates great color on the fruit and helps us to get our fruit to mature in a very attractive way,\u201d Evans said.\nWashington even has its own apple grading standard, with one grade above USDA's U.S. Extra Fancy \u2013 Washington Extra Fancy. About 25% to 30% of its apple crop is exported; most goes to Canada and Mexico.\nApples represent 16% of the state's agricultural production and are so important that in 2020 the state created a Washington Apple license plate.\nMany apples are picked and stored for a year or more\nToday, apples are picked, cleaned and then placed in controlled atmosphere nitrogen-filled storage rooms where oxygen levels are typically 1% to 3%.\n\u201cThat\u2019s the beauty of apples, you can store them for 12 to 15 months and when the consumer buys them, they taste like they were just harvested,\u201d said Torres, of Washington State University.\nAs the apples respire they give off carbon dioxide, which is removed to keep levels at no more than 1%. The temperature is also strictly regulated, generally 33 to 38 degrees, depending on the variety.\nThose storage rooms typically hold 1,500 to 3,000 bins of apples, each of which holds almost 900 pounds of fruit.\n\u201cIf they mess up a room, it\u2019s a lot of money. It could be millions lost,\u201d Torres said.\nAmericans once soured on apples\nApples were a favorite fruit for decades in America, until World War II turned many away from the red globes.\nThe best apples were sold to the military for the nation\u2019s fighting men. Expert pickers and packers were called to war work, leaving often bruised and less-than-ideal fruit for grocery stores on the home front.\n\u201cIt really hurt the reputation, because the apples that were left for civilian consumption weren\u2019t very good,\u201d Van Lanen said.\nIt took much of the 1950s to bring consumers back to apples amid a concerted advertising push on behalf of apple growers to reintroduce consumers to the fruit.\nAmericans like sweet apples, Europeans like tart\nThere\u2019s a clear difference in tastes for apples in Europe, said Stefano Musacchi, a professor of pomology and endowed chair of Tree Fruit Physiology and Management at Washington State University, who originally hails from Italy.\n\u201cIn Europe, all the Mediterranean people like sweet fruit. In northern Europe they like tart fruit. This is why Fuji is so popular in Italy, as well as Gala. In Holland there are other varieties like Jonagold that are more popular because they\u2019re more tart and more acid,\u201d he said.\nAmerican Much prefer sweet apples to tart, said Musacchi.\nBut Gleason says American tastes are starting to change. \"It's still primarily sweet, but people are looking for more complexity,\" he said. He attributes that to the introduction of so many new, more interesting apples in the past several decades.\n\"Once you get introduced to them, you're looking for something that teases your palate.\"\nApples should be refrigerated\nApples have a surprisingly long shelf life, even once they\u2019re out of cold storage \u2013 but put them in the refrigerator when you buy them to keep them at their best.\nOnce out in the air, which is 21% oxygen, \u201ceverything goes fast,\u201d said Torres. \u201cThe texture, the sugars, the acid. The fruit won\u2019t be good.\u201d\nFor an apple grown in Washington state, it takes five to six days to be trucked to the East Coast once it\u2019s removed from the storage room.\nOnce in a supermarket produce section, they are good for about seven days. Once they\u2019re purchased, as long as they\u2019re put in the fridge, they\u2019ll last another two weeks, Torres said.\n\u201cThe low temperature reduces the rate of respiration. The higher the temperature, the higher their respiration. And when they\u2019re respirating, it\u2019s the sugars and acids that are the first to go.\u201d\nApples were once a seasonal treat\nFresh apples all year has been something consumers could depend on only since the 1960s with the widespread advent of controlled refrigerated storage, said Van Lanen of Lewis-Clark State College.\n\u201cBefore World War II, apple juice was a seasonal treat, partly because they didn\u2019t have the technology to freeze it or can it and preserve all the flavor compounds, so the flavors would go very flat,\u201d Van Lanen said.\nInstead, 19th-century Americans used apples in forms that could be more easily preserved: dried (often in pie), applesauce, apple butter or cider vinegar.\nBaking apples has fallen out of favor\nThere used to be three kinds of apples: for eating, for baking and for cider. Today, most supermarkets stock only eating apples.\n\u201cIt is very hard to find cooking apples,\u201d Van Lanen said. \u201cThe eating apples you find in the stores don\u2019t make the best pies. Part of that is driven by consumer tastes \u2013 we just don\u2019t bake as much so there isn\u2019t the demand of the good baking apple.\u201d\nThe 1964 edition of \"Joy of Cooking\" still lists the best apples for eating uncooked, which it calls \u201cdessert apples\u201d and for baking, which include Courtlands, Staymans, Winesaps, Baldwins and Rome Beautys \u201cunless they are overripe. In that condition, they become mealy.\u201d\nToday some of the best, widely available baking bets are Braeburn, Jonathan, Fuji, Gala and Granny Smith. The ideal is an apple firm enough to hold its shape but also stay tasty. For best results, many bakers suggest buying different varieties to give an apple pie or other baked treat depth of flavor.\nNew apples are always in development\nWhat will the next big apple be? Perhaps the WA 64 variety, the most recent apple out of the breeding program at Washington State University's Wenatchee Tree Fruit Research and Extension Center.\nWSU introduced the Cosmic Crisp variety (WA 38) in 2019, though work on breeding it began in 1997.\nThe new WA 64 apple variety doesn\u2019t yet have a catchy name and won\u2019t be in stores until 2029 or 2030, Evans said. But the breeders, who have been working on it since 1998, believe it will be popular.\n\u201cThis one has a pink blush on a yellow background,\" Evans said. It is a cross between the Honeycrisp and Cripps Pink (also known as a Pink Lady) varieties. \u201cI would say it has a better texture, so not quite as dense as a Cripps Pink apple.\u201d",
