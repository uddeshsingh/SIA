This upward revision \u201cmore than offsets\" expected weakness in Mac sales, the firm said.\nBusiness Spotlight: iPhone 16 Performance in China\nThe iPhone 16 outsold its predecessor in China by 20% in the three weeks following its release, according to Counterpoint Research data cited by Bloomberg.\nThat report supports the \u201cChina iPhone rebound thesis,\u201d analysts at Wedbush said. The firm estimates that about 300 million iPhones globally have not been upgraded, paving the way for an \u201cAI-driven super cycle led by iPhone 16.\u201d\nWedbush suggested Apple could also partner with Baidu (BIDU), the dominant internet search engine company in China, to capture the \u201c[artificial intelligence] piece of the China market.\u201d",
