    "maintext": "During Apple\u2019s It\u2019s Glowtime event, the company announced the Apple Watch Series 10. With a thinner design and bigger displays, this device celebrates ten years of the original Apple Watch. Here\u2019s everything we know about this product, including specs, release date, price, watchOS 11, and more.\nThe Apple Watch Series 10 was revealed on September 9, 2024. Pre-orders started on the same day, and it went on sale on September 20.\nDesign: Thinner body, bigger display\nApple says the Apple Watch Series 10 is nearly 10% thinner than the Apple Watch Series 7, Series 8, and Series 9. This wearable is also lighter, as the aluminum case weighs up to 10% less than Series 9 while offering larger 42mm and 46mm display sizes.\nThe larger display offers up to 30 percent more active screen area than Apple Watch Series 4, Series 5, and Series 6, and up to 9 percent more than Apple Watch Series 7, Series 8, and Series 9. With that, Apple says it could improve readability and usability.\nApple Watch Series 10 is the first Apple product to offer an innovative wide-angle OLED display, which optimizes each pixel to emit more light at wider angles. As a result, the display is up to 40 percent brighter than Series 9 when viewed from an angle, making it easier to read at a glance.\nIn addition, the display is more power efficient and enables a faster refresh rate when the Apple Watch is in always-on mode, going from once a minute to once a second.\nColors\nThese are the colors of the new Apple Watch Series 10\nAluminum:\nJet Black\nRose gold\nSilver\nTitanium:\nNatural\nGold\nSlate\nUnfortunately, some users report that the Jet Black color is already easily scratching.\nApple Watch Series 10 new processor\nApple says the new S10 SiP was engineered for better performance, power efficiency, and intelligence (even though it\u2019s non-related to the Apple Intelligence platform). It has a built-in 4-core Neural Engine for smart features, including the double tap gesture, on-device Siri, dictation, and automatic workout detection, and important safety features such as Crash Detection and Fall Detection. It even improved the updated Smart Stack, the redesigned Photos face, and the Translate app in watchOS 11.\nThere\u2019s a new Sleep Apnea Detection sensor\nBuilding on the intelligent health features already available to track key overnight metrics such as heart rate, respiratory rate, and wrist temperature, the Apple Watch now offers a feature to help identify signs of sleep apnea.\nStudies reveal that sleep apnea is a potentially serious condition where breathing stops repeatedly during sleep. The condition, estimated to impact more than 1 billion people worldwide, is undiagnosed in most cases. If left untreated, sleep apnea can have important consequences on health, including an increased risk of hypertension, Type 2 diabetes, and cardiac issues.\nTo detect sleep apnea, Apple Watch uses the accelerometer to monitor small wrist movements associated with interruptions in normal respiratory patterns, tracked by a new Apple Watch metric called Breathing Disturbances. While some of these disturbances are normal, they are important to track as they can be used to help understand restfulness of sleep and, when occurring frequently over multiple nights, may be associated with sleep apnea. Users can view their nightly Breathing Disturbances in the Health app, where they are classified as elevated or not elevated and can be viewed over a one-month, six-month, or one-year period.\nThe FDA approved sleep apnea detection before the Apple Watch Series 10 went on sale. This feature is available for US and Canadian users running watchOS 11.1. More countries and regions will follow soon.\nOther Apple Watch sensors\nApple Watch Series 10 also features these sensors:\nECG app\nCycle Tracking app with retrospective ovulation estimates3\nHeart Rate app\nHigh and low heart rate notifications\nIrregular rhythm notifications\nMindfulness app with state of mind tracking\nNoise app\nSleep app including sleep stages\nTemperature sensing\nEmergency SOS\nInternational emergency calling\nFall Detection\nCrash Detection\nHigh-g accelerometer\nSecond-generation ultrawideband chip\nIf you\u2019re having issues with the Apple Watch Series 10 not tracking your temperature in Vitals, we know how to fix it.\nDepth and Tide apps come to the Apple Watch Series 10\nApple Watch Series 10 has a 50-meter water resistance rating, automatic stroke detection, and lap counting. new depth gauge and water temperature sensor make the Apple Watch Series 10 an even better companion when users are headed into the water.\nThe new depth gauge can measure down to 6 meters beneath the water\u2019s surface, perfect for snorkeling and shallow diving or playing in the pool, lake, or ocean. Additionally, the new water temperature sensor measures the temperature of the water once the Apple Watch has been submerged. The built-in Depth app is highly legible for easy underwater visibility, displaying the time, current depth, water temperature, duration underwater, and maximum depth \u2014 with the option to automatically activate as soon as the Apple Watch is submerged. Water temperature is also displayed in workout metrics during Pool Swim and Open Water Swim workouts.\nTo help users plan and enjoy open water activities and stay aware of changing conditions, watchOS 11 introduces a new Tides app. Users can access seven rolling days of forecasted tidal information for coastlines and surf spots around the globe, including information on high and low tides, rising and falling tides, tide height and direction, and sunrise and sunset, all plotted against a timeline.\nBlood oxygen sensor controversy\nIn early 2024, Apple had to halt Apple Watch Series 9 sales and release a model without blood oxygen measurement in the US due to a patent infringement. With Series 10, Apple continues to face drawbacks, and the new wearable isn\u2019t capable of using this feature as it hasn\u2019t come up with a solution to avoid infringing Massimo\u2019s patents.\nThe same is worth it for the Apple Watch Ultra 2.\nBattery and connectivity\nEven though the Apple Watch Series 10 is thinner than its predecessor, Apple managed to include the same \u201call-day\u201d 18-hour battery. However, it features better charging speeds.\nA new metal back features a larger and more efficient coil, which provides up to eight hours of normal daily use after 15 minutes of charge. Eight minutes of charging powers up to eight hours of sleep tracking. Faster charging also means users can charge to 80 percent battery in about 30 minutes. Apple Watch users have been surprised by its battery life, even though it has one big problem.\nOne interesting tidbit about the new Apple Watch Series 10 is that Apple hasn\u2019t added the red antenna circle to the Digital Crown; it has integrated the feature inside the watch itself.\nI turned off one Apple Watch feature to get amazing battery life\nwatchOS 11 powers Apple Watch Series 10\nWith watchOS 10, Apple completely revamped the Apple Watch experience by redesigning its apps for larger displays. There were new Smart Stack widgets, a revamped Control Center, and so much more. For watchOS 11, Apple polished the Apple Watch system with more Smart Stack features, new Watch Faces, and new health-related features, such as the new Vitals app.\nwatchOS 11.1 features\nOn October 28, Apple released watchOS 11.1 to Apple Watch users. If you have an iPhone running Apple Intelligence, you can get these two features:\nReduce interruptions: An all-new Focus Mode understands the content of your notifications and shows you the ones that might need immediate attention, like a text about picking up your child from daycare later today.\nSummarization: Apple Intelligence can summarize all your notifications.\nBesides that, watchOS 11.1 focuses on bug fixes and security patches.\nwatchOS 11.2 beta features\nApple is currently testing watchOS 11.2. It\u2019s unclear what new features this system brings. We\u2019ll update this article once we learn more about it.\nPrice\nThe Apple Watch Series 10 costs the same as the previous models, but Apple has replaced stainless steel with titanium.\nAluminum, 42mm, GPS: $399\nAluminum, 42mm, GPS + Cellular: $499\nAluminum, 46mm, GPS: $429\nAluminum, 46m, GPS + Cellular: $529\nTitanium, 42mm, GPS + Cellular: $699\nTitanium, 46mm, GPS + Cellular: $749\nHowever, if you want a stainless steel model, the Apple Watch Herm\u00e8s is available at this finish starting from $1,249.\nReview\nBGR praised Apple Watch Series 10 in our review:\nt first glance, the Apple Watch Series 10 isn\u2019t all that much better than the Series 9, and in the grand scheme of things, perhaps it\u2019s not. But all of these minor improvements, especially related to the display, had a big impact on how I used the device. I loved being able to subtly glance at the screen and see the seconds tick on the watch face. I\u2019m also a huge fan of the sleep apnea feature that will hopefully help more people find out if they have a potentially life-altering medical condition. And, I think the Jet Black color brings much more style to the entry-level aluminum Apple Watches. I only wish improvements to the display had come to the Apple Watch Ultra as well.\nWhat about the Apple Watch X?\nBefore Apple released the Apple Watch Series 9, there were a few rumors about a possible Apple Watch X. Although it didn\u2019t make sense at the time since 2023 would mark nine years after the first Apple Watch was released, Cupertino could have introduced an X version instead of Apple Watch Series 10.\nThe rumor started most likely thanks to the iPhone X, which marked the tenth anniversary of the iPhone. With this release, Apple reshaped what an iPhone looked like and elevated it to a higher level. That said, the X confused several people, who called this model by its letter and not the Roman number 10.\nWhile the Apple Watch X brand looks cool, the company didn\u2019t follow this strategy.",
