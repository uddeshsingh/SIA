    "maintext": "Early Black Friday Apple deals are available to shop right now. Thanks to early sales in the US and UK, you can score record-low prices on AirPods, iPads, MacBooks, smartwatches, and more.\nWhile this year's Black Friday deals event takes place on November 29, retailers like Walmart and Best Buy in the US and Argos and Currys in the UK have all launched early Black Friday sales, which include impressive Black Friday Apple deals. You can find the best-ever prices on Apple's newest devices, like the Apple Watch 10, as well as record-low prices on older models, like the AirPods 3 and 10.2 iPad.\nBelow, I've listed today's top Apple sales in the US and UK, followed by today's best early Black Friday Apple deals. I'll update this page with more offers as they become available and the latest Black Friday news.\nThe best early Black Friday Apple sales (US)\nAmazon: AirPods, iPads & MacBooks from $89\nApple: trade-in credits on new devices\nBest Buy: iPad deals from $229.99\nVerizon: Get an iPhone 15 Pro from $37.77/mo\nWalmart: $200 off Watch, AirPods & iPads\nThe best early Black Friday Apple deals (US)\nApple AirTag: was $29 now $19 at Walmart\nThe Apple AirTag is one of Apple's highly coveted gadgets, and it rarely gets discounted, which is why today's Black Friday deal from Walmart is so great. You can get Apple's location tracking device for just $19 - a new record-low price. If you tend to misplace your keys or wallet, attach the AirTag to anything you don't want to lose, and your iPhone will locate the item.\nApple AirPods (2nd Generation): was $159 now $89 at Walmart\nAirPods are always popular during Black Friday, and Walmart has Apple's cheapest AirPods, the AirPods 2, on sale for just $89. That's the best deal you can find right now, only $20 more than the record-low price. This offer is highly recommended if you want new AirPods and don't need noise-canceling technology.\nApple AirPods (3rd Generation): was $169 now $94 at Walmart\nThe AirPods 3 feature a new design with shorter stems that include touch-capacitive force sensors for easy control. The earbuds also deliver impressive sound with spatial audio, resulting in an immersive experience and a MagSafe charging case that provides more than 30 hours of total listening time.\nApple AirPods 4 (without active noise cancellation): was $129 now $119 at Amazon\nI predict Apple's all-new AirPods 4 will be a hot item at this year's Black Friday sale, and you can already grab a first-time discount at Amazon. The AirPods 4 feature a new design for all-day comfort and pack Apple's H2 chip, which supports personalized spatial audio and voice isolation. You're also getting a redesigned case with 30 hours of battery life and supports USB-C for wireless charging.\nYou can also get the AirPods 4 with active noise cancellation on sale for $167.99 (originally $179).\nApple Watch Series 10: was $399.99 now $349 at Walmart\nThis might be the best Walmart Black Friday deal - Apple's all-new Apple Watch 10 is on sale for a record-low price of $349. The Apple Watch 10 includes upgrades such as Apple's new S10 chipset, sleep apnea detection, depth gauge, and a new design featuring the most advanced display. I don't expect you'll find a better price on Black Friday, and this offer is in danger of being sold out.\nApple iPad 10.2 (2021): was $329.99 now $199.99 at Best Buy\nApple's best-selling 10.2 iPad dropped to $199.99 during Prime Day, and Best Buy has brought this excellent deal back ahead of Black Friday. While the tablet is an older model, it still packs a 10.2-inch Retina display, and the A13 Bionic chip ensures excellent picture quality and superior performance. The entry-level tablet can do it all without issue, according to our Apple iPad 10.2 review, whether browsing the net, streaming media, light work, or playing games.\nApple iPad 10.9 (2022): was $349 now $298 at Amazon\nApple slashed the recommended starting price of the iPad 10.9 (2022) to $349 earlier this year, but Amazon has now dropped that figure even further. It's great value for money at this price if you need an all-around tablet. We said Apple's latest base-level tablet is a big upgrade over the previous generation model in our iPad 10.9 (2022) review, with a larger Liquid Retina display, a new A14 Bionic chip, improved cameras, USB-C support, and a sleek design.\nApple iPad mini (64GB, 2021): was $499 now $349 at Amazon\nJust ahead of Black Friday, Amazon has the 2021 iPad mini back down to a new record-low price of $349. You get a powerful A15 Bionic chip, 64GB of storage, and an 8.3-inch Liquid Retina display, making this iPad mini a great choice if you're looking for a smaller tablet with premium features. The handheld iPad is a fantastic buy if you're looking for a smaller tablet that still packs a fully premium specs sheet.\nApple MacBook Air (M1, 2020): was $999 now $649 at Walmart\nDisplay - 13 inches\nProcessor - Apple M1\nRAM - 8GB\nStorage - 256GB\nOS - macOS\nWalmart is offering the MacBook Air M1 for a new record-low price of $649, which is a steal for the device that sat atop our best laptop guide for many months. It may be a little dated now but this is still a powerful Apple device that holds up well in 2024. It can handle most users' computing needs: work, browsing, video calls, and even creative tasks such as video and photo editing.\nApple MacBook Air M2 (2022): was $999 now $799 at Best Buy\nWhile this is a good price for the MacBook Air M2, I'd suggest waiting to see if the previous record-low of $649 is made available again nearer to Black Friday. Even though a newer M3 version is available, we concluded that this is still one of the best laptops you can buy in our MacBook Air M2 review, thanks to the stylish design, clear display, impressive performance, and long 18-hour battery life. For those needing a premium powerhouse for creative apps such as photo editing, video editing and more intense workloads, this is a good offer on an Apple machine right now.\nApple MacBook Pro 14-inch (M3): was $1,399 now $1,099 at Best Buy\nBest Buy has dropped the price of the Apple MacBook Pro with M3 chip to just over $1,000. This is $200 cheaper than the previous record-low price. The 8-core CPU, 10-core GPU, and 8GB of RAM deliver unbelievable performance, making this powerful high-end laptop a great option for content creators or anyone who needs to multitask a lot. Read more about why we loved it so much in our MacBook Pro 14-inch (M3) review.\nThe best Apple sales ahead of Black Friday (UK)\nAmazon: the best prices on Apple devices\nArgos: AirPods, MacBooks, iPhone & more\nVery: discounts on AirPods & MacBook Pro\nCurrys: fast shipping & price matching\nJohn Lewis: AirTags, iPads & Macbooks from \u00a328\nThe best early Black Friday Apple deals (UK)\nApple AirPods 4: was $129 now $119 at Laptops Direct\nThese are very new, so any discount on them is good \u2013 though I'm hoping we'll see another \u00a310 dropped from the price later in Black Friday. The AirPods 4 feature a new design for all-day comfort, and pack Apple's H2 chip, which supports Personalized Spatial Audio and voice isolation. You're also getting a redesigned case with 30 hours of battery life and supports USB-C for wireless charging. This version doesn't include noise cancellation, wireless charging or the Find My speaker in the case.\nApple AirPods 4 with Active Noise Cancellation: was $179 now $169 at Laptops Direct\nIf you want Apple's open-ear design that doesn't go right into your ear canals, but you still want active noise cancellation to make it easier to hear your music, these are the buds for you. They also have spatial audio, Find My in the case (including a speaker), and wireless charging. They sound very fun, too, with a full sound. At \u00a310 off, I'd still advise most people to wait for AirPods Pro 2 to fall to \u00a3180 again and pay a little amount more for even better sound and features \u2013 but if you want this kind of ear fit, this is the best price for these so far.\nApple iPad 10.2 (2021): was $369.99 now $299 at Argos\nThe 2021 iPad may be slightly older tech, but the 10.2-inch Retina display and A13 Bionic chip ensure excellent picture quality and superior performance to this day. The entry-level tablet can do it all without issue, according to our Apple iPad 10.2 review, whether that's browsing the net, streaming media, light work, or playing games. Today's deal at Argos brings the tablet down to \u00a3299, which is a match for the best price yet at the retailer.\nApplegb iPad 10.9 (2022): was \u00a3349 now \u00a3308 at Amazon\nApple slashed the recommended starting price of the iPad 10.9 (2022) to \u00a3349 earlier this year, but Amazon has now dropped that figure even further. This tablet is great value for money if you simply need a reliable all-rounder. We said Apple's latest base-level tablet is a big upgrade over the previous generation model in our iPad 10.9 (2022) review, with a larger Liquid Retina display, a new A14 Bionic chip, improved cameras, USB-C support, and a sleek design. If stock runs low at Amazon, John Lewis is offering the same deal on the same colors.\nApple Watch Series 9 (41mm): was $349 now $299 at Argos\nWhile it's no longer the latest model on the market, no one can deny that the Apple Watch Series 9 isn't an exceptional smartwatch - and one that's still great for the vast majority of users. Alongside the S9 chipset and a great display, the Series 9 features all the excellent lifestyle and fitness apps these watches are known for as well as the exceptionally useful double-tap gesture control.\nApple MacBook Pro 16-inch (M3 Pro, 2024): was \u00a32,799 now \u00a32,549 at Amazon\nDisplay - 16.2 inches\nProcessor - Apple M3 Pro\nRAM - 36GB\nStorage - 512GB\nOS - macOS\nIf you want an incredibly powerful MacBook for creative work, then this deal from Amazon is well worth checking out. You'll save \u00a3250 on this workstation laptop with a huge 36GB of memory, which along with the M3 Pro chip, which includes a 12-core CPU and 18-core GPU, makes this an incredible performer, even if it's no longer the most recent model.\nBlack Friday Apple deals 2024 - FAQs\nWhen is Black Friday?\nBlack Friday 2024 takes place on Friday, November 29.
