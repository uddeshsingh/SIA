    "maintext": "Apple posted a headline beat on Thursday for the fiscal fourth quarter, but investors may have found at least one item to nitpick.\nGreater China revenue, while largely stabilizing after four quarters of declines, missed expectations by about $1 billion. It came in at $15.03 billion, versus $15.08 billion a year before. But the FactSet consensus was for $16.08 billion.\nNumerous companies this earnings season have called out pressure on the consumer in China.\nA highlight for Apple was a beat on iPhone revenue, which came in about $1 billion better than expected at $46.22 billion. Apple CEO Tim Cook said the Apple Intelligence software is \"a compelling upgrade reason.\"\nThe stock was down about 2% in the extended session shortly after the end of Apple's earnings call.\nOne analyst used that term on the earnings call in asking about Apple's 2018 goal to get to a net-cash-neutral position over time. The company has worked down its balance from peak levels. But it's had about $50 billion in net cash over the past two years, the analyst said.\n\"Every time we plan for the upcoming year we think about all the different areas where we can deploy our resources and we make them available to grow the business,\" Maestri said Thursday. \"Our fundamental philosophy is to look after the business first, and then if we have excess cash, we will continue to return it to our shareholders. And the plan has worked quite well so far.\"\nMaestri will continue to lead Apple's corporate services team but exit the CFO role on Jan. 1.\nApple is calling for 46% to 47% gross margins in the fiscal first quarter. For comparison, it posted a 46.2% gross margin in the fiscal fourth quarter.\n\"Most commodities are going to move down in price,\" CFO Luca Maestri said on the earnings call. But NAND and DRAM memory prices increased last quarter and are expected to grow again this quarter.\nCapex, or capital expenditures, is a hot term in the technology world lately, as big companies rush to spend up on artificial-intelligence infrastructure.\nInvestors are a bit jittery about these spending trends for many companies, but Apple isn't spending as much as many Big Tech rivals. CFO Luca Maestri addressed the company's \"hybrid\" approach on the earnings call.\nAsked if the company's new initiatives could drive a departure from Apple's historical tendency to spend about $10 billion on capex, Maestri said that Apple is different than some other companies because it sometimes uses its own data centers and sometimes uses third-party providers.\nApple rolled out iOS 18.1 earlier this week, a software update that contains the Apple Intelligence AI software. Tim Cook says that, three days into that rollout, the adoption rate is twice as high as it was for iOS 17.1 last year.\nNot everyone can access iOS 18.1, which is only available for owners of the iPhone 16 line and iPhone 15 Pro Models.\n\"We believe it's a compelling upgrade reason,\" Cook said.\nApple saves its outlook for the earnings call, and management just shared an expectation for low- to mid-single-digit growth in total revenue for the holiday quarter.\nAnalysts had been modeling $127.7 billion in revenue, which would equate to a 6.8% increase.\nApple also expects a double-digit growth rate for services revenue similar to what the company posted for fiscal 2024, when the category grew 12.9%.\nApple saw Mac and iPad sales increase, but not by enough to meet Wall Street expectations.\nMac sales rose 1.7% to $7.74 billion, but that was below the FactSet consensus of $7.86 billion. And iPad sales grew 7.9% to $6.95 billion, but that was also below expectations of $7.09 billion.\nMeanwhile, Mac sales made up 8.2% of total sales and iPad sales were 7.3% of the total. In last year's Q4, Mac sales were 8.5% of total sales and iPad sales were 7.2% of the total.\nApple reported Q4 sales in the wearables, home and accessories product category, which includes the Apple Watch, of $9.04 billion.\nThat was down 3% from the same period a year ago, and below the FactSet consensus of $9.16 billion.\nThat categories sales represented 9.5% of total sales of $94.93 billion, down from 10.4% of sales in the year-ago quarter.\nApple's high-margin services category came in a bit shy of revenue expectations for the fiscal fourth quarter.\nRevenue from the category was $24.97 billion, while analysts were looking for $25.26 billion.\nApple's Q4 iPhone sales of $46.22 billion was 48.7% of total sales of $94.93 billion, which compares with iPhone sales being 48.9% of the total in the same quarter last year.\nThat's the first year-over-year dip in the percentage for Apple's fourth quarters in four years.\nThe following is the percentage of total sales that iPhone sales were in the fourth quarters that ended on the following years:\nApple came up short on Greater China revenue, which may be weighing on its stock.\nThe company saw its China business largely stabilize, coming in at $15.03 billion versus $15.08 billion a year before. But analysts had been expecting a 6.6% increase, to $16.08 billion.\nChina sales had fallen for four quarters in a row heading into this report.\nShares are down 1% in the extended session.",
