But the QuietComfort Ultra justify their high price tag for one simple reason, and it's right there in the name.

The newer XM5s don't quite justify the price jump, especially when their little sisters are marked down below $200.

If you've got any cool teens on your holiday shopping list, these headphones pack plenty of style.\nThe Best Headphones for Bass Lovers on Cyber Monday: Sony ULT Wear Over-Ear Headphones\nSony\nULT Wear Over-Ear Headphones\nThese headphones haven't quite caught on, and we don't get it.
