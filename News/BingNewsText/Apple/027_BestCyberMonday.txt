    "maintext": "We're more than halfway through Cyber Monday, but fortunately you can still snag some of the best Cyber Monday iPhone deals while they\u2019re still in stock. So let us guide you towards the top deals on the latest iPhones as well as older models that are still worth buying at a discounted price.\nIt may sound like a typo, but one of the best Cyber Monday deals has been one that gives you an iPhone 16 or 16 Pro for just one cent up front. You just need to sign up for a Boost Infinite Plan, which provides unlimited data for $65/month. The same $0.01 offer applies to the iPhone 16 Pro, but that model's been out of stock at various points this weekend. If you want the Pro version for a penny, act now.\nWant your iPhone 16 with a different carrier? Best Buy gives you a $100 gift card when you buy an iPhone 16 tied to AT&T. Verizon-owned Visible is offering a $250 gift card for iPhone 16 Pro Max purchases. (Other iPhones fetch gift cards with smaller amounts from Visible.)\nAs for older models, the iPhone 15 is just $349 with an unlimited plan at Boost Mobile. You just don't get access to Apple Intelligence features that run on the iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 16 models.\nSpeaking of older models, Apple isn't offering any discounts on its phones for Cyber Monday. But the iPhone maker's Apple Store Shopping Event wraps up at the end of the day, and you can pick up a $75 gift card should you buy an iPhone 15, iPhone 14 or iPhone SE directly from Apple. It's a way to save if you plan on making future purchases at Apple's store.\nHere's the best Cyber Monday iPhone deals we've spotted so far today.
