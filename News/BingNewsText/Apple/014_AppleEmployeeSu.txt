    "maintext": "Apple is being sued by an employee who claims the tech giant\u2019s \u201cspeech suppression policies\u201d unlawfully restrict its workers from talking about their experience at the company. The same lawsuit, filed Monday in Santa Clara, California, calls Apple a \u201csurveillance capitalist\u201d that violates its employees\u2019 privacy by tracking their personal iPhones and other devices.\n\u201cApple\u2019s speech suppression policies have harmed \u2013 and continue to harm \u2013 Apple\u2019s employees,\u201d the lawsuit claims. \u201cThe secrecy permits the wrongdoing to continue. This is a real and ongoing concern.\u201d\nThe lawsuit was filed in state court by Apple employee Amar Bhakta, who has managed digital ads for the company since joining in 2020. Bhakta and his lawyers claim Apple violates its employees right to free speech by imposing stiff restrictions on what they can talk about.\nThis hurts employees in several ways, the lawsuit claims, including: blocking them from discussing their wages and work conditions; \u201cinvades\u201d employee privacy by having them submit to having their nonwork devices surveilled; and allowing Apple to unlawfully \u201cclawback\u201d earned wages.\n\u201cApple\u2019s surveillance policies and practices chill, and thus also unlawfully restrain, employee whistleblowing, competition, freedom of employee movement in the job market, and freedom of speech,\u201d the lawsuit claims.\nIn particular, Bhakta was upset the company \u201cforbade\u201d him from discussing his job on podcasts and in other public settings, as well as required him to edit some information on his LinkedIn page \u2014 something that hurts his future job prospects, the lawsuit claims.\nApple did not immediately respond to TheWrap\u2019s request for comment.\n\u201cAt Apple, we\u2019re focused on creating the best products and services in the world and we work to protect the inventions our teams create for customers,\u201d Apple spokesperson Josh Rosenstock said in a statement to The Verge. \u201cEvery employee has the right to discuss their wages, hours and working conditions and this is part of our business conduct policy, which all employees are trained on annually. We strongly disagree with these claims and believe they lack merit.\u201d\nThe tech company, headquartered in nearby Cupertino, California, has access to personal emails, photos, and health information, among other private details, thanks to its overreaching surveillance, the lawsuit added. Apple violated California law by requiring employees to allow the company to \u201cengage in physical, video, and electronic surveillance\u201d of them, the suit continued.\n\u201cThe personal data contained on an iPhone or other digital devices is more than private. It is also valuable,\u201d the lawsuit continued. \u201cPersonal data is the fuel of surveillance capitalism.\u201d\nAnd employees who wish to switch from Apple to Google or other non-Apple products to avoid surveillance are put in a tricky spot, according to the lawsuit.\n\u201cThe cost to employees of switching to a non-Apple device for purely personal reasons is too high,\u201d the lawsuit claims, pointing to Apple\u2019s \u201cmonopoly power\u201d on the U.S. smartphone market. \u201cApple\u2019s employees, even more so than Apple\u2019s customers, are trapped in Apple\u2019s prison yard.\u201d\nThe lawsuit does not specify how much Bhakta is seeking in damages.\nPamela Chelin contributed to this report.",
