    "maintext": "The first time I witnessed the challenges of disability was when I started college in 2016. My hostel mates came from across Asia and Africa, pursuing different career paths and hobbies, each with their own cultural identity and lived experiences.\nBack then, an entire wing of my hostel was dedicated to blind students and peers with limited vision. Running into them in the alleys, en route to the dining halls, or toward the college \u2014 and guiding them to their destination, hand in hand \u2014 quickly became a daily routine.\nThe short conversations were always fascinating, and their memorization of entire volumes of Urdu poetry never ceased to amaze me. During the exam season, I regularly volunteered as a writer while my friends narrated the answers.\nIt was a revelatory experience for me, yet two aspects stood out. First was the permanent presence of smartphones in their lives. Second, despite being a deemed national university, there was an utter lack of disability assistance, especially for blind residents or guests on the entire campus.\nThese shortcomings range from unplanned infrastructure to a lack of a supportive tech stack. Saif Khan, an architect, tells me that there aren\u2019t any standard directives in place to make buildings accessible for blind people. \u201cThe best we do is build ramps for people with motor disabilities,\u201d Khan, who owns Pause Design Studio in India\u2019s national capital, tells Digital Trends.\nThe situation is grim for multiple reasons. Dr. Arif Waqar, who has worked extensively with blind people, tells me that even in medical science academia, the focus is more on the curative side rather than solving the existing problems.\n\u201cWe are not banking on the technical innovation side. And that means real-world problems continue to persist without a universal solution. Navigation assistance is one of them,\u201d Waqar says.\nA new way to assist blind people\nA team from the University of California, Santa Cruz, wants to use smartphone apps to help blind people navigate buildings. Notably, these applications do not require any pre-existing technical setup and need only a phone\u2019s internal sensors. Not even the camera module is part of the equation here.\nRoberto Manduchi, professor of computer science and engineering at UC Santa Cruz, spearheaded the development of these apps to help blind users move within a building using audio cues. The most convenient \u2014 and safest \u2014 part is that users don\u2019t need to hold the phone while at it.\nThink of these two apps \u2014 named Wayfinding and Backtracking \u2014 as the GPS equivalent for indoor navigation. However, unlike other attempts that require pre-installed sensors in buildings or non-reliable GPS, these apps need only the sensors fitted inside a phone to offer guidance.\nSpecifically, the team used readings from the inertial sensors \u2013 the accelerometer, gyroscope, and magnetometer \u2014 to measure the navigation progress. Though mainly reliant on smartphone speakers for vocal cues, the apps can also be paired with a smartwatch.\nFive meters ahead of each turn, the apps instruct the user about the upcoming change in direction. While the Wayfinding app helps with entry and navigation, the Backtracking app uses the blueprint of the initial journey and simply reverses it to provide the necessary guidance.\nIn the near future, the team hopes to integrate computer vision tech into the apps. That would allow users to click a picture of their surroundings when they find themselves in a tricky spot and have the AI describe the world around them.\nThe vision is similar to how modern AI chatbots can now process images, allowing users to simply point the camera and let the AI make sense of it.\nHow it all works\nAs part of the tests, the team at UC Santa Cruz had seven blind participants who used the Wayfinding app to move past routes, which had 13 turns in total. Next, they used the Backtracking app to retrace their original path on the return journey.\nThese apps are not reliant on any external infrastructure, nor do they require users to hold the phones in a certain position to capture data from their surroundings. The apps work fine even when the phone is tucked safely in the pockets.\nThis is a crucial victory from a convenience standpoint. \u201cBlind travelers normally use a long cane or a dog guide, and thus have one hand already occupied maneuvering the cane or holding the dog,\u201d says the research paper, which has been published in the ACM Transactions on Accessible Computing journal.\nFor the Wayfinding app, the team tested two separate algorithms: Azimuth/Steps and RoNIN. The first one borrows from the concept of step tracking, creating a two-dimensional step vector at each recorded step and directional information pulled from the phone\u2019s onboard compass.\nTo estimate the user\u2019s position, a \u201cdead reckoning\u201d system is applied. \u201cThis is akin to the old navigation technique that computed a ship\u2019s path using the compass for heading and a chip log (a rope with a number of regularly placed knots) for speed,\u201d Manduchi explains. \u201cYou reconstruct the ship\u2019s path by drawing a line on the map based on measured heading and speed.\u201d\nAlgorithmic errors \u2014 or \u201cdrift\u201d \u2014 are inevitable. To counter that, the team used a technique called particle filtering, which is mostly used for spatial tracking. In this case, particle filtering was used to add certain corrective constraints to avoid this drift.\n\u201cWe cannot cross walls (unless we are Superman). Adding these prior constraints (drawing from the underlying floor plans) dramatically reduces the effect of drift,\u201d Manduchi tells Digital Trends.\nThe RoNIN algorithm was mostly deployed as a failsafe and comparative analysis, and during the course of testing, it was only required once. For estimation of the shortest route, the apps rely on Apple\u2019s GameplayKit system, a framework predominantly used for building games. Notably, Apple already has an indoor map framework available for developers.\nThe team also used smartwatch-based controls on an Apple Watch, using a mix of controls including touch-based swipe, Digital Crown movement, and VoiceOver. The apps alert users about the next turn, wrong movement patterns, nearby landmarks, and when they enter a new route segment.\nThe team expressed confidence in the inertial-based localization technique driving the app, predominantly because it\u2019s accessible and doesn\u2019t require any external infrastructure to offer guidance services. However, Manduchi tells me that Wayfinding and Backtracking are \u201conly experimental apps, still far from a distribution version.\u201d\nNotably, the team is considering the open-source route via the UCSC Center for Research on Open Source Software platform. However, a public release might take some time in order to address \u201cseveral practical issues,\u201d Manduchi says. Unfortunately, one of those issues is fundamental in nature.\nThe big caveat\nConvenience is a recurring theme behind the two apps, and it seems there are no demanding hardware limitations. I asked if the apps required a certain level of silicon firepower during testing or if the finished app had a performance baseline.\nManduchi tells me there are no such performance expectations from the native hardware, as the team tested the two apps on an iPhone X, which came out eight years ago. It is safe to assume that when the two apps are released publicly, most iPhone owners will be able to run them with ease.\nNow, the Wayfinding app is driven by the availability of floor plans. It would be useless if the app didn\u2019t have the floor plan already saved in its directory. More specifically, the building floor plans need to be fed in a vectorized format.\nManduchi\u2019s team has already solved one side of that crucial hurdle. \u201cWe created a web app that facilitates vectorization of a floor plan in any existing format, such that it can be used by our app,\u201d Manduchi tells Digital Trends. He says they are looking to release the web app publicly in the near future.\nThe real obstacle is the availability of these building maps, vectorized or otherwise. \u201cOur experience is that availability of floor plans of public buildings is spotty, and available floor plans can be in various formats,\u201d Manduchi tells me.\nThat problem can only be solved with voluntary participation or if the state decides to intervene. \u201cAs an architect, I give my clients the floor plan or digital sketch map in PDF format, because that\u2019s what they need to see. Realistically speaking, the hefty vector maps in IMDF files are of no use to them,\u201d Khan tells me.\nHe emphasizes that there is no such thing as a hardline trade secret involved here, but most architecture firms or entities won\u2019t share the 3D vector maps. \u201cThink of it like an intellectual property, something that is the foundation of the work I did,\u201d Khan tells me.\nThese vector maps are usually created in demanding apps like Revit or AutoCAD and can only be viewed or manipulated using those apps. So, it makes little sense to share them either way, as the client only needs a floor map that they can open and comprehend, like drawings on a simple PDF or digital sheet.\nEven if the current owner of a certain building agrees to supply a copy of the map for apps like Wayfinding, they would first have to track down the architect or planning firm behind it. They may or may not be able to share for logistics, contractual, or any other legally protected reason.\nHowever, the situation becomes even trickier for buildings run by government entities. These could be anything from the nearest public hospital to the local metro train station. Applying for a permit and getting it approved to access the vectorized maps could be a long-drawn-out and tedious process.\nIn India, for example, university campuses, public infrastructure, and government offices were built during the British colonial era. Finding a map or even an architectural floor plan would be like finding a needle in a historical haystack.\nThe only path forward would be to digitally remap them professionally, which would be another massive undertaking. For now, open-sourcing seems to be the only meaningful path ahead, as that would at least ensure that Wayfinding and Backtracking apps can provide navigation assistance in any meaningful capacity.\n\u201cThere is no architectural provision for blind people. There are no enforceable guidelines,\u201d Khan tells me. \u201cThese apps at least offer a viable route fix to walk past those mistakes.\u201d",
