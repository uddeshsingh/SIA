    "maintext": "Media magnate Jimmy Lai, who has been unjustly imprisoned in solitary confinement for nearly four years because of his support for Hong Kong\u2019s pro-democracy movement, continues to testify in his own defense, witnessing as much to his Catholic faith as to his innocence.\nLai\u2019s testimony, which began on Nov. 20, is exposing the flimsiness of the charges against him. But even more, it highlights the unswerving determination of this heroic Chinese Catholic to tell the truth \u2014 no matter the personal cost.\nOf course, truth has never had anything to do with the trumped-up charges leveled against Lai. Local Chinese authorities claim he colluded with a broad range of foreign actors, including senior members of the Trump administration, with the objective of separating Hong Kong from China\u2019s control. This is a total fiction. Lai\u2019s \u201ccrime,\u201d as publisher of the pro-democracy Apple Daily newspaper, was to allow his publication to report accurately about Beijing\u2019s continuing betrayals of its 1997 promises to preserve Hong Kong\u2019s existing civil liberties for at least 50 years, which the communist regime gave as a condition for securing the U.K.\u2019s handover of control over its former colony.\nTo clamp down on this journalistic truth-telling, Hong Kong police invaded Apple Daily\u2019s offices in August of 2020 and carted Lai away in handcuffs, shortly after a draconian new national security law came into effect. In 2021, he was convicted on a charge of fraud and sentenced to six years in jail. If convicted of the more serious charges of collusion and sedition he is now facing, he could receive an additional life sentence.\nNone of this has cowed Lai. Appearing in court at long last to defend himself, he forcefully rebutted prosecution claims that he had promoted Hong Kong\u2019s independence from China. He specifically instructed the staff of Apple Daily never to do that, he testified, stressing that the newspaper\u2019s priorities instead \u201care actually the core values of the people of Hong Kong,\u201d including the \u201crule of law, freedom, pursuit of democracy, freedom of speech, freedom of religion, freedom of assembly.\u201d\nIndeed, Lai told the court, he decided to become a newspaper publisher specifically \u201cto participate in delivering information, which is delivering freedom.\u201d And he sought always to state only things that he believed to be true. \u201cFor truth prevails in God\u2019s kingdom, and that\u2019s good enough for me,\u201d he explained.\nThe depth of Lai\u2019s commitment to truth and to freedom, anchored in his Christian faith, has astonished even his closest friends.\n\u201cJimmy believes we were created for truth and that it is our job to speak the truth, especially when no one else will, at whatever the cost,\u201d Wall Street Journal columnist William McGurn said at the National Catholic Prayer Breakfast in Washington in 2022. \u201cHow else could a man so willingly exchange the comfortable life of a Hong Kong multimillionaire for the prison cell of a Chinese dissident?\u201d\nMcGurn, who befriended Lai when he lived in Hong Kong in the 1990s and who became his godfather when Lai converted to Catholicism in 1997, believes the criminal proceedings have turned into a fiasco for the Chinese and Hong Kong governments, courtesy of their failure to break Lai\u2019s spirit.\n\u201cWith all this, the trial is only showing what everyone in Hong Kong already knows: Jimmy was an incredibly engaged publisher whose journalism proved highly popular,\u201d he wrote last month.\nPresident-elect Donald Trump has been following Lai\u2019s case closely and has committed to press for his release when he takes office. Chinese authorities might be inclined to comply with Trump\u2019s request \u2014 if only to spare themselves from further embarrassment stemming from Lai\u2019s ongoing witness to the truth from his jail cell. Meanwhile, it\u2019s critical that we continue to pray for this brave, good man.",
