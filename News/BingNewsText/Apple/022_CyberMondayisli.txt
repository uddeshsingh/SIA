    "maintext": "Table of Contents\nAmazon's Black Friday sale went live Nov. 21 (a full week before Thanksgiving), ushering in year-round low prices on robot vacuums, Apple products, and Fire TVs.\nNow that Cyber Monday has arrived (and is quickly approaching its final hours), the Mashable Shopping team is tracking all of the remaining discounts so you don't have to. We're refreshing our picks on a regular basis, so keep checking back as we add deals throughout the final hours of Cyber Monday 2024.\nEven if you're brand loyal to Amazon (and we don't blame you), definitely keep an eye on our coverage of the other big retailers \u2014 Walmart, Best Buy, and Target are going hard, and Amazon doesn't always have the lowest prices. Another smart shopping strategy: Use the Amazon-friendly price tracker CamelCamelCamel to see if the latest deal is a good one, or add the item to your wishlist to get notified as soon as it goes on sale.\nDon't forget: the Amazon Cyber Monday sale officially ends at 11:59 p.m. PT on Dec. 2, so don't take these deals for granted. Amazon's extended holiday return window applies to most items bought between Nov. 1 and Dec. 31, but Apple products are a notable exception.\nNote: All newly added or updated deals have been marked with a \u2728, while struck-through deals were either sold out or expired at the time of writing. Any deal marked with a \ud83d\udd25 has dropped to a record-low price.\nBest Cyber Monday Kindle deal\nWhy we like it\n\"The new batch of 2024 Kindles is the fastest yet, turning pages quickly and with less delay when switching between books in your library. The Kindle Paperwhite and Signature Edition both have bright, high-contrast screens, so you can read in any environment. While I prefer the Kindle Paperwhite over the Signature Edition most of the time, right now you can't beat the SE's Black Friday price.\" \u2014 Samantha Mangino, Shopping Reporter\nThe Amazon Kindle Paperwhite Signature Edition is 23% off, bringing it down to $154.99. That's some big savings ($45 to be exact) on a device that's usually $200. You get everything you love in the Paperwhite \u2014 a lightweight and waterproof design \u2014 with the added benefits of double the storage, wireless charging, and auto-adjusting brightness.\nMore Kindle deals at Amazon\nNew 2024 Kindle \u2014 $84.99 $109.99 (save $25) \ud83d\udd25\nKindle Kids \u2014 $94.99 $129.99 (save $35) \ud83d\udd25\nAmazon Kindle without lockscreen ads \u2014 $104.99 $129.99 (save $25) \ud83d\udd25\nKindle Paperwhite \u2014 $129.99 $159.99 (save $30) \ud83d\udd25\nKindle Essentials Bundle \u2014 $116.97 $161.97 (save $45)\nAmazon Kindle Paperwhite Kids \u2014 $139.99 $179.99 (save $40)\nKindle Paperwhite Signature Edition \u2014 $154.99 $199.99 (save $45) \ud83d\udd25\nKindle Paperwhite Essentials Bundle \u2014 $184.97 $204.97 (save $20)\nKindle Paperwhite Signature Edition Essentials Bundle \u2014 $237.97 $257.97 (save $20)\nKindle Colorsoft Essentials Bundle \u2014 $349.97 $384.97 (save $35)\nKindle Scribe with Basic Pen \u2014 $269.99 $339.99 (save $70)\nKindle Scribe Essentials Bundle \u2014 $329.97 $439.97 (save $110)\nBest Cyber Monday Echo deal\nWhy we like it\nFor less than $20, why not add the convenience of being able to ask Alexa anything in any room of your home? Even if you can't see yourself being a full-screened Echo person, the Pop can subtly squeeze into any living situation. You won't even know it's there \u2014 until you're making dinner and can simply ask Alexa for measurement conversions out loud rather than actually figuring out the math. Then you'll definitely know it's there.\nUpdate: You can buy the Echo Pop and get a free Amazon Basics smart color light bulb with your purchase.\nMore Echo deals at Amazon\nAmazon Echo Dot \u2014 $22.99 $49.99 (save $27) \ud83d\udd25\nAmazon Echo Pop and Globe Electric Smart Color Bulb bundle \u2014 $27.98 $51.98 (save $24)\nAmazon Echo Dot Kids \u2014 $27.99 $59.99 (save $32) \ud83d\udd25\nAmazon Echo Buds with ANC \u2014 $34.99 $119.99 (save $85) \ud83d\udd25\nAmazon Echo Spot \u2014 $44.99 $79.99 (save $35) \ud83d\udd25\nAmazon Echo Show 5 \u2014 $44.99 $89.99 (save $45) \ud83d\udd25\nAmazon Echo \u2014 $54.99 $99.99 (save $45) \ud83d\udd25\nAmazon Echo Show 8 \u2014 $79.99 $149.99 (save $70) \ud83d\udd25\nAmazon Echo Glow \u2014 $16.99 $29.99 (save $13)\nAmazon Echo Hub \u2014 $124.99 $179.99 (save $55)\nBest Cyber Monday Fire Tablet deal\nWhy we like it\nRead Mashable's full rev iew of the Amazon Fire HD 10 (2023).\n\"Amazon's Fire HD 10 tablet is a lot friendlier on the wallet than an iPad. With a 10.1-inch screen, it's similar in size, but it's also a fraction of the price. In our review of the Amazon Fire HD 10, we delighted in its lightweight design and long battery life. The biggest downside to Amazon's Fire tablets are the limited selection of apps offered, especially compared the the Google Play and Apple store.\n\"That being said, it's still not a bad choice for those who want a tablet for streaming or reading through the Kindle app \u2014 especially when the Fire HD 10 is down to its lowest price ever of $74.99. That's a generous 46% off for $65 in savings.\" \u2014 Samantha Mangino, Shopping Reporter\nMore Fire Tablet deals at Amazon\nAmazon Fire 7 Kids \u2014 $54.99 $109.99 (save $55) \ud83d\udd25\nAmazon Fire HD 8 (32GB) \u2014 $54.99 $99.99 (save $45) \ud83d\udd25\nAmazon Fire HD 10 Kids Pro \u2014 $109.99 $189.99 (save $80) \ud83d\udd25\nAmazon Fire Max 11 (64GB) \u2014 $139.99 $229.99 (save $90) \ud83d\udd25\nAmazon Fire 7 \u2014 $44.99 $79.99 (save $35)\nAmazon Fire 7 Kids Squishmallow Bundle \u2014 $54.99 ($119.98) (save $64.99)\nBest Cyber Monday robot vacuum deal\nWhy we like it\n\"This nearly 50% off discount on the Roomba Combo j5+ is stellar at first glance, but it looks like an even sweeter deal when compared to the current deal on the cheapest self-emptying Roomba, the Roomba Vac 2. For $249.99, that bare-bones Roomba doesn't mop and can't smart map your house. For $299 \u2014 just $50 more \u2014 the Roomba Combo i5+ can mop and can smart map to clean specific rooms in your home on command. If $300 is your budget cap for a new robot vacuum, spending that extra $50 is a no-brainer.\nThe only downside to choosing the Combo i5+ over the more advanced Combo j5+ is that the i series Roombas don't have small obstacle avoidance technology, so they can't dodge things on the floor like charging cords or pet waste. However, if your home is already pretty tidy as it is, or you're down to deal with tidying up ahead of vacuuming, the Combo i5+ is a total steal at this price.\" \u2014 Leah Stodart, Senior Shopping Reporter\nMore robot vacuum deals at Amazon\niRobot Roomba Q0120 robot vacuum \u2014 $149 $249.99 (save $100.99) \ud83d\udd25\nEufy L60 \u2014 $179.99 $279.99 (save $100) \ud83d\udd25\nEufy L60 with self-empty station \u2014 $279.99 $398.99 (save $119) \ud83d\udd25\nEufy X8 Pro with self-empty station \u2014 $349.99 $649.99 (save $300) \ud83d\udd25\nRobot vacuum and mop combos\nRoborock Q7 Max \u2014 $199.99 $599.99 (save $400) \ud83d\udd25\niRobot Roomba Combo i5+ with self-empty station \u2014 $299 $549.99 (save $250.99)\nShark Matrix Plus 2-in-1 with self-empty station \u2014 $349.99 $699.99 (save $350) \ud83d\udd25\niRobot Roomba Combo j5+ with self-empty station \u2014 $399 $729.99 (save $330.99)\nEufy Omni C20 self-empty and mop washing station \u2014 $399.99 $599.99 (save $200) \ud83d\udd25\nNarwal Freo with self-empty and mop washing station \u2014 $499.99 $899.99 (save $400)\nEufy X10 Pro Omni with self-empty and mop washing station \u2014 $549.99 $799.99 (save $250) \ud83d\udd25\nYeedi M12 Pro+ with self-empty and mop washing station \u2014 $549.99 $999 (save $449.01) \ud83d\udd25\nDreame L10s Pro Ultra with self-empty and mop washing station \u2014 $549.99 $999.99 (save $450) \ud83d\udd25\nShark RV2820YE PowerDetect 2-in-1 with self-empty and mop washing station \u2014 $549.99 $899.99 (save $350) \ud83d\udd25\nEcovacs Deebot T30S with self-empty and mop washing station \u2014 $599.99 $999.99 (save $400) \ud83d\udd25\nShark AV2800ZE PowerDetect NeverTouch Pro robot vacuum and mop combo \u2014 $699.99 $1,199.99 (save $500) \ud83d\udd25\nNarwal Freo X Ultra with self-empty and mop washing station \u2014 $799.99 $1,399.99 (save $600) \ud83d\udd25\nEcovacs Deebot X2 Omni with self-empty and mop washing station \u2014 $899.99 $1,499.99 (save $600)\nRoborock Qrevo Master robot vacuum and mop combo \u2014 $899.99 $1,399.99 (save $500)\nRoborock Qrevo MaxV robot vacuum and mop \u2014 $899.99 $1,399.99 (save $500)\nBest Cyber Monday TV deal\nWhy we like it\nFor our top TV pick at Amazon, we previously went with this massive 75-incher from TCL \u2014 and there was a lot to love about it. But we know not everyone has the space for a TV that big, no matter how affordable. So as we round out Black Friday, we have to call your attention to another budget-friendly TCL TV, the 65-inch Class S5 Fire TV.\nDon't get us wrong, this is definitely a basic TV. Its LED display isn't as sharp as its QLED or OLED competitors. However, $349.99 for a 65-inch TV seems, frankly, absurd. Despite all the inflation we've seen in recent years, 65-inch TVs remain stubbornly immune, and we're not complaining. This TV uses the Amazon Fire TV OS to connect you to your favorite streaming apps. You'll also get the benefit of an HDR PRO+ display, Dolby Atmos sound, and an Alexa voice remote.\nMore TV deals at Amazon\n24- to 40-inch TVs\nInsignia 24-Inch Class F20 Series Smart Fire TV \u2014 $74.99 $109.99 (save $35)\nInsignia 32-Inch Class F20 Series Smart Fire TV \u2014 $99.97 $169.99 (save $70.02)\nAmazon Fire TV 40-inch 2-Series \u2014 $149.99 $249.99 (save $100)\n43-inch TVs\nToshiba 43-inch C350 4K Fire TV \u2014 $169.99 $279.99 (save $110)\nAmazon 43-inch 4-Series 4K Fire TV \u2014 $229.99 $369.99 (save $140) \ud83d\udd25\nAmazon 43-inch 4-Series 4K Fire TV (latest version) \u2014 $269.99 $329.99 (save $60 with Prime) \ud83d\udd25\u2728\nSamsung The Frame 43-Inch Class 4K QLED TV \u2014 $797.99 $997.99 (save $200) \ud83d\udd25\n50- to 55-inch TVs\nAmazon 50-inch Omni 4K Fire TV \u2014 $329.99 $479.99 (save $150)\nAmazon 55-inch 4-Series 4K Fire TV \u2014 $339.99 $519.99 (save $180)\nAmazon 55-inch Omni 4K Fire TV \u2014 $369.99 $549.99 (save $180)\nAmazon 55-inch Fire TV Omni QLED 4K TV \u2014 $419.99 $599.99 (save $180)\nSamsung 55-inch The Frame QLED 4K TV \u2014 $897.99 $1,497.99 (save $600) \ud83d\udd25\n65-inch TVs\nRoku 65-inch 4K TV \u2014 $299.99 $449.99 (save $150)\nTCL 65-inch Q5 QLED 4K Fire TV \u2014 $429.99 $549.99 (save $120)\nAmazon 65-inch Fire TV Omni QLED 4K TV \u2014 $599.99 $799.99 (save $200)\nTCL 65-inch QM7 QLED 4K TV \u2014 $697.99 $1,099.99 (save $402) \ud83d\udd25\nHisense 65-inch U7 Series 4K Mini-LED QLED TV \u2014 $697.99 $999.99 (save $302) \ud83d\udd25\nHisense 65-inch Canvas QLED 4K TV \u2014 $799.99 $1,299.99 (save $500)\nAmazon 65-inch Omni Mini-LED QLED Fire TV \u2014 $919.99 $1,089.99 (save $170 with Prime) \ud83d\udd25\nLG 65-inch evo C3 OLED 4K TV \u2014 $1,196.99 $1,499.99 (save $303)\nSamsung 65-inch The Frame QLED 4K TV \u2014 $1,297.97 $1,997.99 (save $700) \ud83d\udd25\nSamsung 65-inch S90D OLED 4K TV \u2014 $1,397.97 $2,197.99 (save $800)\nLG 65-inch evo C4 OLED 4K TV \u2014 $1,496.99 $2,699.99 (save $1,203)\nSamsung 65-Inch Class QLED 4K QN90D Series \u2014 $1,497.99 $2,297.99 (save $800)\nLG 65-inch G3 OLED 4K TV \u2014 $1,996.99 $2,796.99 (save $800)\n75-inch TVs and up\nTCL 75-inch Q5 QLED 4K Fire TV \u2014 $549.99 $749.99 (save $200)\nAmazon 75-inch Omni 4K Fire TV \u2014 $699.99 $1,049.99 (save $280)\nTCL 85-inch Q65 Mini LED ULED 4K TV \u2014 $879.98 $1,729.98 (save $850)\nTCL 75-inch QM7 QLED 4K TV \u2014 $897.99 $1,499.99 (save $602)\nSony 85-inch X77L 4K TV \u2014 $998 $1,498 (save $500)\nBest Cyber Monday Apple deal\nWhy we like it\nRead Mashable's full review of the Apple MacBook Pro (M4).\n\"In our all-new testing, Apple's latest MacBook Pro lasted almost 17 hours on a single charge and outperformed the M3 version by 27 percent. Mashable Tech Editor Kim Gedeon was impressed by its power efficiency, its stellar speakers, and its upgraded 12MP webcam, rating it a 4.2/5, but said that 'at a starting price of $1,599, it\u2019s an investment that\u2019s not for the faint of heart.' (On the plus side, it starts with 16GB of RAM.)\nAmazon's doing its best to remedy that issue this Cyber Monday, bringing the space black base configuration down to an unprecedented price of $1,399.99, or $200 off. (For comparison's sake, it was $1,499 at Best Buy at the time of writing.) A lot of MacBooks hit new record lows at Amazon this Cyber Weekend, and this is one of the very few models that hasn't sold out or floated up to a higher price yet.

Dropped down to $298, these headphones are at a dollar cheaper than their Prime Day price.\" \u2014 Bethany Allard, Lead Shopping Reporter\nMore headphones deals at Amazon\nNoise-cancelling over-ear and on-ear headphones\nJBL Tune 760NC \u2014 $69.95 $129.95 (save $60)\nSkullcandy Hesh \u2014 $79.88 $134.99 (save $55.11)\nSony WH-CH720N \u2014 $88 $149.99 (save $61.99) \ud83d\udd25\nBeats Solo 4 \u2014 $99.99 $199.95 (save $99.96) \ud83d\udd25\nSony ULT WEAR \u2014 $148.99 $199.99 (save $50)\nBeats Studio Pro \u2014 $159.99 $349.99 (save $190)\nBose QuietComfort headphones \u2014 $199.99 $349 (save $150)\ud83d\udd25\nSony WH-1000XM4 \u2014 $198 $348 (save $150) \ud83d\udd25\nBowers & Wilkins Px7 S2e \u2014 $279 $399 (save $120)\nSonos Ace \u2014 $349 $449 (save $100)\ud83d\udd25\nDyson OnTrac \u2014 $449.99 $499.99 (save $50)\ud83d\udd25\nNoise-cancelling earbuds\nMashable Deals\nWant more hand-picked deals from our shopping experts?\nSign up for the Mashable Deals newsletter.\nBy signing up you agree to our Terms of Use and Privacy Policy.\nThanks for signing up!\nAmazon Echo Buds with ANC \u2014 $34.99 $119.99 (save $85) \ud83d\udd25\nAnker Soundcore Space A40 earbuds \u2014 $44.99 $79.99 (save $35)\nSamsung Galaxy Buds FE \u2014 $57.98 $99.99 (save $42.01)\ud83d\udd25\nJabra Elite 4 \u2014 $59.99 $99.99 (save $40)\nAnker Soundcore Liberty 4NC \u2014 $59.99 $99.99 (save $40)\nJBL Live Pro 2 \u2014 $74.95 $149.95 (save $75)\ud83d\udd25\nBeats Studio Buds \u2014 $79.99 $149.95 (save $69.96)\nSennheiser ACCENTUM \u2014 $119.95 $199.95 (save $80)\nBeats Studio Buds + \u2014 $119.99 $169.95 (save $49.96)\nSony LinkBuds S \u2014 $128 $199.99 (save $71.99)\nBose QuietComfort earbuds \u2014 $129 $179 (save $50)\ud83d\udd25\nJabra Elite 10 \u2014 $149.99 $249.99 (save $100)\nJabra Elite 8 Active \u2014 $169.99 $229.99 (save $60)\nApple AirPods Pro 2 \u2014 $153.99 $249 (save $95.01) \ud83d\udd25\nGoogle Pixel Buds Pro 2 \u2014 $179 $229 (save $)\nBose QuietComfort Ultra earbuds \u2014 $229 $279.99 (save $50.00)\nSony WF-1000XM5 \u2014 $228 $299.99 (save $71.99)\nBest Cyber Monday fitness tracker deal\nWhy we like it\nJust released in August, this is the first time the new Google Pixel Watch 3 has ever gone on sale for less than $300. Unfortunately, the larger 45mm screen is still at full price, but even this 41mm model has a 10% larger display than the same size Pixel Watch 2, thanks to smaller bezels. The Pixel Watch 3's display is also just brighter and zippier in general, without sacrificing that 24-hour battery life.\nOn that screen, you'll be able to swipe through a more detailed running dashboard than the previous generation, check your heart rate changes from sleep, to regular daytime chilling, to a legit cardio workout, make payments via Google Wallet, and more.\nMore fitness tracker and smartwatch deals at Amazon\nAmazfit Bip 5 (46mm) \u2014 $69.99 $89.99 (save $20)\nAmazfit Active (42mm) \u2014 $84.99 $109.99 (save $25)a\nGarmin Forerunner 55 (42mm) \u2014 $149.99 $199.99 (save $50)\nApple Watch SE, 2nd Gen (40mm, GPS) \u2014 $149 $249 (save $100)\nGarmin Vivoactive 5 \u2014 $189.99 $299.99 (save $110)\nGarmin Venu 3S (41mm) \u2014 $349.99 $449.99 (save $100)\nApple Watch Series 10 (46mm, GPS) \u2014 $359 $429 (save $70)\nAmazfit Band 7 \u2014 $39.99 $49.99 (save $10)\nSamsung Galaxy Watch 6 (44mm) \u2014 $159.99 $329.99 (save $170)\nApple Watch Series 9 (41mm, GPS) \u2014 $279.99 $399 (save $119.01)\nSmart rings\nOura Ring Gen3 Horizon \u2014 $235.10 $299 (save $63.90)\nOura Ring Gen3 Heritage \u2014 $320.09 $449 (save $128.91)\nBest Cyber Monday kitchen deal\nWhy we like it\nIf Thanksgiving prep had you wishing for another burner, there's a way to get one without overhauling your entire stove. Instant Pots are truly do-it-all appliances, letting you saut\u00e9, steam, and pressure cook all in one little pot. As Black Friday is winding down, so are the deals, and we've seen some Instant Pots sales dwindle.\nLuckily, you can still find the drastically discounted Instant Pot 10-in-1 Pro (6 quart) for 42% off. Shop it ahead of Cyber Monday for just $98.99, and you'll be a master of it by the time your next holiday meal comes around.\nMore kitchen deals at Amazon\nInstant Pot\nInstant Pot Superior Cooker (7.5 quart) \u2014 $50.99 $79.99 (save $29)\nInstant Pot 9-in-1 Duo Plus (8 quart) \u2014 $99.95 $149.95 (save $50)\nInstant Pot 10-in-1 Pro (6 quart) \u2014 $98.99 $169.99 (save $71)\nInstant Pot 13-in-1 Duo Crisp with Ultimate Lid (6.5 quart) \u2014 $149.95 $229.99 (save $80.04)\nAir fryers and pizza ovens\nInstant Vortex Plus Air Fryer (10 quart) \u2014 $84.99 $149.99 (save $65)\nCuisinart Indoor Pizza Oven \u2014 $199.65 $399.95 (save $200)\nChefman Indoor Pizza Oven \u2014 $199.99 $399.99 (save $200)\nNinja Foodi Smart XL 6-in-1 Indoor Grill and Air Fryer (DG551) \u2014 $169.99 $279.99 (save $110)\nCoffee makers\nKeurig K-Supreme \u2014 $99 $169.99 (save $70.99)\nNespresso Vertuo Pop+ Coffee and Espresso Maker \u2014 $125.97 $179.95 (save $53.98)\nTechnivorm Moccamaster 79112 KBT Coffee Brewer \u2014 $236.99 $339 (save $102.01) \ud83d\udd25\nDe'Longhi La Specialista Arte Evo Espresso Maker \u2014 $499 $749.95 (save $250.95)\nEco-friendly kitchen gear\nStasher silicone reusable storage bag (104 oz) \u2014 $20.44 $34.99 (save $14.55)\nAirthereal Electric Kitchen Composter \u2014 $199.99 $349.99 (save $150) \ud83d\udd25\nLomi Electric Kitchen Composter \u2014 $249.99 $379 (save $129.01 with on-page coupon) \ud83d\udd25\nBeauty tech deals\nWhy we like it\nIf a multistyler like the Airwrap or FlexStyle feels like it'll be overkill for your hair routine, you might consider a nice (but still multifaceted) hair dryer like the Shark SpeedStyle. It's one of Mashable Lead Shopping Reporter Bethany Allard's favorite Dyson Supersonic dupes, particularly for smoothing \u2014 its QuickSmooth brush in particular not only dries hair quickly, but \"keeps things from looking too windswept and more styled and volumized.\" This version also comes with a diffuser for defined curls, a concentrator for sleek, straight styles, and a FrizzFighter finishing tool.\nMore beauty tech deals at Amazon\nBondi Boost Blowout Brush Pro \u2014 $48.99 $69.99 (save $21) \ud83d\udd25\nBondi Boost Aloe Plated Flat Iron \u2014 $55.99 $119 (save $63.01) \ud83d\udd25\nDreame Gleame hair dryer \u2014 $64.99 $99.99 (save $35)\u2728\nDreame Pocket Foldable Hair Dryer \u2014 $99.99 $159.99 (save $60) \ud83d\udd25\nShark HyperAir\u2014 $129.99 $229.99 (save $100)\nShark FlexStyle \u2014 $229 $299.99 (save $70.99) \ud83d\udd25\nDyson Supersonic\u2014 $329 $429.99 (save $100.99) \ud83d\udd25\nDyson Airstrait \u2014 $399 $499.99 (save $100.99) \ud83d\udd25\nDyson Airwrap\u2014 $489.99 $599.99 (save $110) \ud83d\udd25\nBondi Boost Wave Triple Barrel Curling Iron \u2014 $28.41 $40.59 (save $12.18 with Prime)\nBeachwaver B1 Rotating Curling Iron \u2014 $55.20 $99 (save $43.80)\nCyber Monday Outdoor deals at Amazon\nWhy we like it\nJackery does one thing, and they do it very well. They make user-friendly, long-lasting, and durable power stations. That's it. That singular focus is also why we love them. And for Cyber Monday, Jackery is offering up to 50% off its most popular products. These power stations have become common fixtures at campgrounds, festivals, and tailgates in recent years, but they're also extremely useful in emergency situations. Pair them with a Jackery solar panel, and they turn into an eco-friendly generator.\nMore Cyber Monday outdoor deals at Amazon\nStanley Classic Legendary Camp Mug \u2014 $17.25 $23 (save $5.75)\nLifeStraw Peak Series Personal Water Filter \u2014 $17.77 $24.95 (save $7)\nOwala FreeSip Insulated Water Bottle \u2014 $23 $27.99 (save $5)\nColeman Chiller Soft Cooler \u2014 $25.99 $32.99 (save $7)\nStanley Classic Travel French Press \u2014 $27 $36 (save $9 with on-page coupon)\nIntex Dura-Beam Plus Deluxe Air Mattress (Queen) \u2014 $29.99 $52.79 (save $22.80)\nHydro Flask Wide Mouth Water Bottle (32-ounce) \u2014 $33.71 $44.95 (save $11.24)\nHydro Flask Wide Mouth Chug Cap Water Bottle (40-ounce) \u2014 $37.46 $50 (save $13)\nRTIC 15-Can Everyday Cooler \u2014 $33.98 $45.99 (save $12)\nLifeStraw Personal Water Filter (5-pack) \u2014 $45.50 $79.95 (save $34.45)\nGCI Outdoor Rocker Camping Chair \u2014 $56 $70 (save $14)\nSolo Stove Bonfire 2.0 with stand \u2014 $195.99 $344.99 (save $149)\nYeti Roadie 24 Cooler \u2014 $200 $250 (save $50)\nYeti Hopper M15 Soft Cooler \u2014 $225 $300 (save $75)\nGoPro HERO12 Black \u2014 $299 $399.99 (save $100.99)\nYeti Roadie 60 Wheeled Cooler \u2014 $360 $450 (save $90)\nTraeger Grills Pro 34 Grill and Smoker \u2014 $494.98 $699.99 (save $205.01)\nThule 615 Pulse Rack (Large) \u2014 $518.95 $649.95 (save $131)\nGaming deals at Amazon\nXbox\nXbox Game Pass Core 3-Month Membership \u2014 $23.74 $24.99 (save $1.25)\nAmazon Fire TV Stick 4K + Xbox Wireless Controller + 1-Month Game Pass Ultimate Bundle \u2014 $74.99 $131.97 (save $56.98)\nXbox Elite Series 2 Core Controller \u2014 $115.99 $139.99 (save $24)\nXbox Seagate Storage Expansion Card (2TB) \u2014 $199.99 $359.99 (save $160)\nXbox Series X (1TB) \u2014 $399.99 $449.99 (save $50)\nPlayStation\nFinal Fantasy XVI \u2014 $24.99 $49.99 (save $25.00)\nWarhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 \u2014 $49.99 $69.99 (save $20)\nPlayStation DualSense Wireless Controller \u2014 $54 $74.99 (save $20.99)\nBackbone One (PlayStation Edition) \u2014 $69 $99.99 (save $30.99)\nRazer Wolverine V2 Pro Controller \u2014 $170.01 $249.99 (save $79.98)\nNintendo Switch\nPowerA Joy-Con Comfort Grips for Nintendo Switch \u2014 $9.88 $14.99 (save $5.11)\nPowerA Joy-Con Charging Dock for Nintendo Switch \u2014 $14.99 $22.99 (save $8)\nSanDisk 128GB microSDXC Card \u2014 $14.99 $34.99 (save $20)\nPrince of Persia: The Lost Crown \u2014 $17.97 $49.99 (save $32.02)\nTeenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutants Unleashed \u2014 $19.99 $39.99 (save $20 with on-page coupon)\u2728\nPDP Afterglow Wave Wireless Pro Controller \u2014 $40.99 $54.99 (save $14.99)\nCRKD Nitro Deck \u2014 $49.99 $69.99 (save $20)\nSpeaker deals at Amazon\nJBL Go 3 \u2014 $29.95 $39.95 (save $10)\nJBL Flip 6 \u2014 $79.95 $129.95 (save $50)\nSony ULT Field 1 \u2014 $98 $129.99 (save $31.99)\nMarshall Emberton II \u2014 $99.99 $169.99 (save $70)\nUltimate Ears Boom 4 \u2014 $99.99 $149.99 (save $50)\nBeats Pill \u2014 $99.95 $149.95 (save $50)\nBose SoundLink Flex \u2014 $119 $149 (save $30)\nHarman Kardon Go+Play Mini \u2014 $199.95 $399.99 (save $200.04)\nUltimate Ears Epicboom \u2014 $249.99 $349.99 (save $100)\nBose SoundLink Max \u2014 $299 $399 (save $100)\nSony XV500 \u2014 $298 $399.99 (save $101.99)\nDeals under $25 at Amazon\nNote: Some deals are repeated from the above list.\nAmazon smart plug \u2014 $12.99 $24.99 (save $12)\nAnker Zolo portable charging bank \u2014 $15.59 $25.99 (save $10.40)\nHero Cosmetics Mighty Patch \u2014 $16.49 $21.97 (save $5.48)\nAmazon Echo Pop \u2014 $17.99 $39.99 (save $22) \ud83d\udd25\nAmazon Fire TV Stick HD \u2014 $17.99 $34.99 (save $17)\ud83d\udd25\nSanDisk 256GB Extreme microSD \u2014 $21.49 $27.99 (save $6.50)\nLoop Quiet 2 earplugs \u2014 $22.35 $27.95 (save $5.60)\u2728\nAmazon Echo Dot \u2014 $22.99 $49.99 (save $27) \ud83d\udd25\nJust Dance 2025 for Nintendo Switch \u2014 $19.99 $49.99 (save $30)\ud83d\udd25\nAmazon Echo Buds \u2014 $24.99 $49.99 (save $25) \ud83d\udd25\nPet deals at Amazon\nBenebone Wishbone Durable Dog Chew Toy \u2014 $7 $11.45 (save $4.45)\nChom Chom Pet Hair Remover \u2014 $11.75 $27.99 (save $16.24 with on-page coupon)\u2728\ud83d\udd25\nAncestryDNA Know Your Pet DNA test \u2014 $69 $99 (save $30)\nEmbark Breed & Health Kit \u2014 $120 $199 (save $79)\u2728\ud83d\udd25\nFurbo 360\u00b0 Dog Camera \u2014 $129 $210 (save $81)\nCheck out our sister site PCMag's best Black Friday deals list for more options.",
