    "maintext": "Meta Platforms META is set to report its third-quarter 2024 results on Oct. 30.\nIt expects total revenues between $38.5 billion and $41 billion for the third quarter of 2024.\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter revenues is pegged at $40.16 billion, indicating an increase of 17.62% from the year-ago quarter\u2019s reported figure.\nThe consensus mark for earnings stands at $5.17 per share, up a couple of cents over the past 30 days, suggesting growth of 17.77% from the figure reported in the year-ago quarter.\nMeta Platforms\u2019 earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in all the trailing four quarters, the average surprise being 12.61%.\nMeta Platforms, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise\nMeta Platforms, Inc. price-eps-surprise | Meta Platforms, Inc. Quote\nFind the latest EPS estimates and surprises on Zacks Earnings Calendar .\nLet\u2019s see how things have shaped up for the upcoming announcement.\nStrong Advertising to Aid META\u2019s Q3 Results\nMETA is riding on strong advertising revenue growth prospects. In the second quarter of 2024, advertising revenues increased 21.7% year over year to $38.33 billion, accounting for 97.9% of revenues. At constant currency, advertising revenues increased 23% year over year.\nMeta Platforms\u2019 advertising revenues are expected to benefit from strong spending by advertisers as they leverage its growing AI prowess.\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter 2024 advertising revenues is currently pegged at $39.38 billion, suggesting 17.04% year-over-year growth.\nMeta Platforms\u2019 offerings \u2014 WhatsApp, Instagram, Messenger and Facebook \u2014 currently reach more than three billion people daily. Their staggering reach and increasing ad impressions (up 10% year over year in the second quarter of 2024) make META one of the most important players in the digital ad sales market, apart from Alphabet\u2019s GOOGL Google and YouTube.\nMETA has been leveraging AI and machine learning to boost the potency of its social-media offerings, including WhatsApp, Instagram, Facebook and Threads. Effective usage of AI has been helping the company keep its users engaged. AI-driven feed recommendations have been a key catalyst.\nHowever, rising expenses related to investments in developing more advanced models and AI services are expected to keep margins under pressure. The Reality Labs business continues to burn cash, which doesn\u2019t bode well for META\u2019s near-term prospects.\nMETA Shares Outperform Sector, Industry\nMETA shares have gained 60.4% year to date (YTD), outperforming the Zacks Computer & Technology sector\u2019s return of 25.3% and the Zacks Internet Software Industry\u2019s 21.3%.\nMeta Platforms shares have also outperformed most of its \u201cMagnificent 7\u201d peers, including Apple AAPL, Alphabet, Amazon AMZN, Microsoft and Tesla YTD. NVIDIA is the only Magnificent 7 stock that has outperformed META shares over the same timeframe.\nApple, Alphabet, Amazon, Microsoft, and Tesla shares have returned 19.8%, 16.5%, 22.7%, 13% and 4.9%, respectively. NVIDIA shares have appreciated 183.6% YTD.\nYear-to-Date Performance Chart\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nMeta Platforms stock is not so cheap, as the Value Score of C suggests a stretched valuation at this moment.\nIn terms of the forward 12-month Price/Sales ratio, META is trading at 7.96X, higher than the broader sector\u2019s 6.14X and the industry\u2019s 2.67X.\nPrice/Sales (P/S) Ratio\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nMETA Leverages AI to Boost Growth\nAI is heavily dependent on data, of which META has a trove, driven by its more than 3.2 billion daily users. Meta Platforms has been leveraging AI to improve the potency of its platform offerings, including WhatsApp, Instagram, Messenger and Facebook.\nMETA\u2019s growing footprint among young adults, driven by improving recommendations, boosts its competitive prowess. AI usage is making it a popular name among advertisers. This is expected to drive top-line growth.\nAn expanded portfolio with the launch of a cheaper Quest 3S headset, Orion Augmented Reality glasses, new AI features for Ray-Ban Meta glasses and new multimodal features for Meta AI is a noteworthy development.\nThe cheaper Quest 3S offers the same mixed reality experience and fast performance as the Meta Quest 3. META also dropped the price of the Quest 3 512 GB version. These developments are expected to improve META\u2019s competitive prowess against Apple\u2019s AR device, Vision Pro.\nExpanding integrations with Spotify and Amazon Music, as well as new partnerships with Audible and iHeart, are expected to enhance the experience for Ray-Ban Meta AR glass users.\nDespite concerns over the monetization of its AI services in the near term and extending regulatory concerns, META\u2019s growth prospects are huge, driven by the growing adoption of its services. A Growth Score of B reflects this enormous opportunity for investors.\nConclusion\nMETA\u2019s use of AI bodes well for its near-term and long-term prospects. Despite a stretched valuation and growing regulatory concerns, we believe Meta Platforms\u2019 robust service offerings make the stock too attractive to ignore.\nMeta Platforms currently has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), suggesting that investors should start accumulating the stock now.
