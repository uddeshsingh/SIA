    "maintext": "Olivia Edwards understands the intent behind Australia\u2019s recent blanket social media ban.\n\u201cIt makes sense,\u201d she said. \u201cThe thought behind it is protecting children.\u201d\nThe new law established some of the most stringent internet usage restrictions outside of China and other non-democratic regimes and could be considered a precedent for other governments to act.\nIt restricts all people under the age of 16 from using social media.\nAustralia is not alone in its attempts to curb social media use. Government bodies in Florida, Texas, France and the United Kingdom have attempted or are considering raising social media age limits or tightening content oversight.\nAs someone who grew up surrounded by social media, Edwards, 25, of Shadyside said bullying online has gotten out of hand. She said stories from her school days and in the current-day news of teens and younger children considering and even committing suicide are consistently tragic stories that come with the territory of social media.\nQuestionable enforcement\nDespite seeing the need for some type of regulation, Edwards said an outright ban seems like a longshot in the U.S.\n\u201cWith how big social media is \u2014 and how much enforcement it would need and how big the U.S. is \u2014 I don\u2019t see how it would ever work,\u201d Edwards said.\nWhile most social media platforms have age requirements to start an account, there are no checks to make sure the account creator is honest about what age they\u2019re registering as.\nLizzy Williams, 29, of Jeannette said she was 14 or 15 when Facebook started.\n\u201cWe all lied about our age,\u201d Williams said. She said it was easy for her and her friends to type in what year of birth was required, and there was no confirmation needed that would prove them dishonest.\nDana Soltesz of Delmont said she doesn\u2019t think social media should be banned for minors but noted it should be more restrictive.\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure how well it could be enforced,\u201d she said. \u201cSocial media can be beneficial in so many ways, but unfortunately it has so many downsides, especially for minors.\u201d\nAustralia\u2019s law will make platforms including TikTok, Facebook, Snapchat, Reddit, X and Instagram liable for fines of up to the equivalent of $33 million (U.S.) for systemic failures to prevent children younger than 16 from holding accounts.\nThe platforms have one year to work out how they could implement the ban before penalties are enforced.\nEdwards said effective enforcement in America most likely would have to be a collaboration between the social media platforms and the government.\n\u201cI just don\u2019t know how realistic that (collaboration) would be considering how protective people are of the First Amendment and what a large topic it is right now,\u201d Edwards said.\nA Florida bill prohibiting children under 14 from having social media accounts has faced legal challenges, as have moves from states such as Arkansas and Ohio that would require minors to secure parental approval to use social media.\nSocial media in schools\nWilliams agreed with Australia\u2019s proposal for social media platforms. She is the mother of three young children. She thinks between 16 and 18 is a good age to let them access social media.\n\u201cComing from someone who was bullied in high school on social media, it\u2019s just too easy to be attacked online,\u201d she said.\nThe World Health Organization issued one of the clearest warnings in September after studying social media use among almost 280,000 school-age children in 44 countries and regions, one of the largest surveys of its kind. The WHO warned of far-reaching consequences for adolescent development and their long-term health stemming from the rise in problematic social media use.\nNoreen Dodds, 60, of East McKeesport said she \u201cabsolutely agrees\u201d with Australia\u2019s decision to ban social media for young children and teens, saying that social media forces children to mature before they\u2019re ready.\n\u201cI think social media influences kids to make decisions they aren\u2019t old enough to make,\u201d Dodds said.\nJeanine Gevaudan, 52, of Oakmont said she isn\u2019t outraged by the idea of a social media ban for young people. She is a middle school teacher and said she sees the negative effects social media has on her students every day.\n\u201cI can see how kids that are young are being influenced, and it\u2019s not always good,\u201d Gevaudan said.\nNot only has social media affected how students interact with each other, it\u2019s changed the responsibilities of the schools. Gevaudan said her school has implemented lesson plans about cybersecurity for younger students. She and other teachers help students learn appropriate behavior on social media and how to combat possibly dangerous situations.\nDespite these lessons, students still face hardships with cyberbullying.\n\u201cWhen I was growing up, if you had issues at school, it was at school and you could go home. But now there\u2019s no break from it,\u201d Gevaudan said. \u201cI think kids say things online that they would never say in person because they feel like there\u2019s a shield online.\u201d\nShe said she\u2019s had to correct inflammatory language in her classroom multiple times because students have begun to form their opinions based on what they see on social media.\n\u201cI think we already try to limit (social media) through parental controls. But then it falls on the parent, and we can\u2019t really regulate them either,\u201d Gevaudan said.\nKeeping kids away\nDespite thinking a ban would be a good idea, Williams said she doesn\u2019t see how the government would be able to effectively keep children off social media.\n\u201cTeenagers are very, very creative when they want something. And they\u2019re very smart when it comes to technology that even when they police it, (teens) will find a loophole,\u201d she said.\nNico Mocker has an Instagram account that he has almost never used. Other than YouTube, that\u2019s the extent of the 17-year-old Pittsburgh resident\u2019s social media use.\n\u201cI\u2019m kind of wary about having pictures on social media,\u201d Mocker said. \u201cThose are on the internet forever, and you can\u2019t get rid of them.\u201d\nMocker did not think a blanket ban on minors\u2019 access to social media was the answer, however.\n\u201cI think it ignores all the positives of social media, and it doesn\u2019t really address the root of the problem, which is the harmful effects of algorithms silo-ing people into a distorted view of reality, and the effects of advertising,\u201d he said.\nIn addition, Mocker said he didn\u2019t know how such a ban would or could be enforced.\n\u201cThere are so many websites today that are supposed to be restricted by age, and you can just lie about it,\u201d he said. \u201cI think it would be more effective \u2014 and would help the issues that adults also have with social media \u2014 if they regulated the industry a little more.\u201d\nUNICEF, the United Nations agency for children, said Australia\u2019s ban would push young people into darker, unregulated places online. The law also risks compromising children\u2019s rights and severing their access to information that\u2019s vital to their welfare, UNICEF said.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know at this point,\u201d Dodds said. \u201cI think (social media) has been too introduced and too accessible. It\u2019s already out there, and it\u2019s going to be hard to take away.\u201d\nWhat the platforms are saying\nWhile Australia\u2019s ban is wildly popular with voters \u2014 77% support the move, according to a YouGov survey \u2014 it has unleashed a maelstrom of criticism from big tech.\nAlmost all of the largest social media companies including TikTok, X and Meta, which owns Facebook and Instagram, expressed concerns about the law in submissions to a truncated Senate inquiry before the bill passed.\nMajor operators including Meta Platforms Inc. say the rules are ineffective or flawed, while X, owned by Elon Musk, questioned whether the ban is lawful, heralding a possible court challenge.\nTikTok, owned by China\u2019s ByteDance Ltd., called the legislation rushed, unworkable and riddled with unanswered questions and unresolved concerns.\nSnapchat owner Snap Inc. said previous international attempts at broad and mandatory age verification had failed.\nKate Manka of Murrysville said that while she thinks banning social media for minors would be a great idea, she also would consider it government overreach.\n\u201cThey\u2019re treading on a very fine line between what they think is best and parental rights,\u201d she said. \u201cIn the end, they wouldn\u2019t be successful in keeping kids off of it. They\u2019ll always find a way to access it.\u201d\nYouTube, deemed by the Australian government to be a health- and education-related platform, is exempt from the ban, despite the comments section being similar to most other social media platforms. Online gaming and messaging services like WhatsApp and Discord also are exempt, even though they can be used for bullying and grooming.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a tough call because I absolutely do believe parents should limit social media,\u201d Manka said. \u201cMy kids are now 25 and 22. Around four years ago, my son decided to get off all social media because, in his words, it\u2019s literally nothing but garbage.\u201d\nBut she said a federal ban is not the solution.",
