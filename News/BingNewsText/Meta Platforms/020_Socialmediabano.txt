    "maintext": "Facebook owner Meta has revealed that it \u2013 and every other social media platform \u2013 will have to start collecting the biometric data of Australian children to comply with the Albanese government\u2019s landmark social media ban.\nThe new law, which is designed to stop children under the age of 16 from accessing social media, was passed after a three-hour debate in parliament. It received bipartisan support, despite tech and child-safety experts warning that the bill was too rushed.\nWhat our policymakers did not spell out was how social media titans would verify a child\u2019s age to ensure it complied with the ban.\nThere is a thought in Canberra that companies like Facebook owner Meta \u2013 which is valued at $US1.4 trillion \u2013 possess the best technology in the world and therefore can simply \u201cfigure it out\u201d.\nBut such thinking represents breathtaking naivety.\nWhile Meta spends about 27 per cent of its revenue, or more than $US40bn a year, on research and development, trusting it and other tech companies such as Chinese-owned TikTok to come up solutions to government problems, is dangerous.\nAustralian Human Rights Commissioner Lorraine Finlay and National Children\u2019s Commissioner Anne Hollonds attempted to warn the government, saying a social media ban \u201coversimplifies a complex issue and carries the risk of unintended harms\u201d, particularly in regard to the collection of biometric data.\nThey said it represented a significant privacy risk to millions.\n\u201cEnforcing a ban would require some form of age assurance, potentially involving biometric data or official identification documents,\u201d they said.\n\u201cSocial media companies, such as US-owned Meta and Chinese-owned TikTok, would need to collect this sensitive information from millions of Australians.\n\u201cRelying on tech giants to manage sensitive data is a risky gamble, particularly without robust legal protections in place.\u201d\nBunnings sparked a fierce debate when the Privacy Commissioner slammed the hardware chain\u2019s use of facial recognition cameras at its stores without customers\u2019 consent.\nAnd the same core issues are at play. Bunnings wanted to keep its staff safe from armed robberies and violence, and the Albanese government wanted to keep children safe from social media-fuelled harms such as bullying, which can have tragic consequences.\nBut ensuring safety while not creating unintended consequences is a delicate balance \u2013 and as UNSW Founders director of entrepreneurship David Burt says: \u201cWe must be careful that today\u2019s easy solution isn\u2019t tomorrow\u2019s absolute disaster\u201d.\nA key concern for the individuals \u2013 in this case children \u2013 is that biometric data cannot be reset and can be used to commit identity fraud, create fake legal documents, passports, bank accounts and access sensitive information such as medical details.\nThen there is the creation of artificial intelligence-powered deep fakes. And where will children\u2019s biometric data be stored, in Australia or elsewhere in jurisdictions the laws of which may not align with our own?\n\u201cIt feels good to ban something, it sounds so decisive. \u2018Kids addicted to social media? No problem, it\u2019s banned\u2019,\u201d Burt says.\n\u201cThis outrage doesn\u2019t solve the problem though. The problem is addiction, an unthinking consumption of media. The solution isn\u2019t abstinence. It\u2019s taking responsibility to teach children how to think.\u201d\nFinlay and Hollands agree.\n\u201cIt is clear we must do more to better protect children online and provide more support for parents and carers,\u201d they say.\n\u201cSocial media can cause real harm and has already had a devastating impact on too many families across the country.\n\u201cBut instead of masking these problems with a ban, we need to treat the underlying causes.\n\u201cImproving education around digital literacy and online safety in schools will equip young people with the tools they need to navigate social media responsibly.\n\u201cOur kids need to be supported to think critically about what they see online and how they engage with social media. Parents and teachers, too, need better resources to guide young people in this space.\u201d\nThis article first appeared in The Australian.",
