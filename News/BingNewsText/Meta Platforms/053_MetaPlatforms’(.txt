    "maintext": "Meta Platforms (META) has recorded a remarkable 80% surge over the past year, and yet, its Q3 report suggests there\u2019s room for further upside ahead. Specifically, Meta showcased robust growth across all key operating metrics, including user growth, ad impressions, and ad pricing. Moreover, the social media giant\u2019s profits surged, a trend likely to persist, indicating that META stock remains attractive today. Hence, Meta Platforms remains my largest position, and I continue to hold a bullish outlook on the stock.\nSustaining Exceptional Growth in Key Operating Metrics\nWhat truly impressed me about Meta\u2019s Q3 results wasn\u2019t any single highlight but rather the fact that the company maintained exceptional growth across all key operating metrics. Daily Active People (DAP) in its app ecosystem reached a record 3.29 billion, representing a 5% year-over-year increase. Meta\u2019s continued single-digit growth, with nearly half the planet using at least one of its apps daily, is just astounding.\nThis growth, alongside heightened engagement across platforms such as Instagram and Facebook, led to a 7% year-over-year increase in ad impressions. Now add the notable 11% increase in the average price per ad, and you get a 19% increase, bringing revenues of $40.6 billion, a new record for the social media giant.\nAI-Driven Recommendations Boosted Time Spent on Apps\nThese metrics were driven by Meta\u2019s focus on improving user experiences and its continued advances in AI. In the post-earnings call, Mark Zuckerberg highlighted that AI-driven recommendations boosted time spent on Facebook by 8% and on Instagram by 6% this year alone.\nAI has also been critical in maintaining high engagement levels by delivering personalized and relevant content. A good example is Meta\u2019s AI-driven video suggestions, which have helped surface trending and engaging Reel content, keeping users active for longer periods.\nOverall, I believe that such a sustained growth rate is remarkable. In fact, Meta\u2019s five-year average revenue CAGR of 18.1% indicates that the company is showing no signs of slowing down. I think it makes sense to remain optimistic about Meta\u2019s future revenue growth. AI tools, such as generative image tools, have only now begun rolling out but are already improving ad targeting and making ads more visually stimulating. This kind of innovation is likely to keep fueling Meta\u2019s top and overall monetization potential.\nProfitability Soars Due to Scale and Efficiencies\nMeta\u2019s profits also surged in Q3, with operating income increasing by 26% year-over-year to $17.4 billion and its operating margin expanding to 43% from 40% last year. This margin expansion was driven by economies of scale as Meta\u2019s user base grew and by measures aimed at streamlining costs.\nFor example, Meta has pursued automation in data center management, thus reducing labor costs, optimizing resource allocation, and lowering operational expenditures. The decline in general and administrative expenses by 10%, largely due to lower legal expenses, also contributed to this margin boost. In turn, earnings surged by 35% year-over-year to $15.7 billion, while diluted EPS rose by 37% to $6.03, further aided by buybacks.\nSurging Profits Expose Meta\u2019s Cheap Valuation\nDespite the stock\u2019s prolonged rally over the past year, as I mentioned earlier, Meta\u2019s surging profits make its current valuation appear notably cheap, in my view. Based on Meta\u2019s year-to-date numbers and management\u2019s outlook, consensus estimates place Meta\u2019s 2024 EPS at $22.51. At the current stock price, this implies a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of just 25.2. This is a relatively cheap multiple, considering Meta\u2019s ongoing momentum and favorable position in an AI-powered future.\nI also find it interesting that Wall Street\u2019s EPS estimates for next year, projecting growth of just 11.7%, are likely quite conservative, too, as they imply a significant slowdown. A similar scenario took place last year when Wall Street\u2019s initial EPS estimate for 2024 was $17.33, significantly lower than the updated estimate of $22.51 today, which Meta will likely be able to beat, too.\nThus, I believe the market is underestimating Meta\u2019s potential to sustain strong earnings growth. This makes the current and forward valuation multiples a compelling catalyst for continued upside.\nIs META Stock a Buy, According to Analysts?\nWall Street sentiment toward Meta Platforms remains highly optimistic, with analysts collectively rating the stock as a Strong Buy. Over the past three months, Meta has gathered 41 Buys, three Holds, and just one Sell. The average META price target of $654.23 implies a potential upside of 14.29% from current levels.\nSee more TICKER analyst ratings\nIf you\u2019re unsure which analyst to trust for trading META stock, Ronald Josey of Citi stands out as the most accurate over a one-year timeframe. His recommendations have delivered an average return of 40.90% per rating, with an impressive 82% success rate.\nConclusion\nOverall, Meta Platforms once again exhibited tremendous growth across its key operating metrics in Q3, driving impressive top and bottom line gains. With an ever-expanding user base, AI-powered tools that drive heightened engagement, and rising ad pricing trends, I believe Meta remains well-positioned for sustained long-term success. In the meantime, despite a significant rally, the stock remains attractively valued, suggesting continued upside potential ahead.",
