    "maintext": "Meta Platforms Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg said that the social media company is going to keep spending on building out its infrastructure because the opportunity is so huge.\n\"The formula around...building out the infrastructures is, you know, maybe not what investors want to hear in the near term, that we're growing that,\" he said. \"But, you know, I just think that the opportunities here are really big.\"\nEarlier, Meta said it would be increasing its capital spending range to $38 billion and $40 billion this year, up from its previous plans to spend between $37 billion and $40 billion.\n\"We're going to continue investing significantly in this,\" Zuckerberg said. \"I'm proud of the teams that are doing great work to build up a large amount of capacity so that way we can deliver world-class models and world-class products.\"\nMeta said that it does not expect its newest social platform Threads to be a big revenue driver in 2025.\n\"We don't expect Threads to be a meaningful driver of 2025 revenue at this time,\" Meta Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg told analysts on the company's conference call. \"We've been just, you know, pleased with the growth trajectory and again, are really focused on introducing features that the community finds valuable and working to deepen growth and engagement.\"\nMeta said Threads now has almost 275 million monthly active users and has been growing more than a million sign-ups per day.\nMeta Platforms said that it is still working on its budget for 2025 but hinted that it is looking at where to add headcount.\n\"We don't have specifics to share about headcount growth in 2025,\" Chief Financial Officer Susan Li told analysts. But she added that the company is looking at opportunities to invest in strategic priorities, such as monetization, infrastructure, Reality Labs, generative AI, and ongoing investments in regulation and compliance.\nEarlier, Meta said its headcount grew 9% in the third quarter, the first time the company has had growth in employees in many quarters.\nMeta said its daily active user number was 3.29 billion on average for September, up 5%, but slightly lower than analysts had expected.\nAccording to FactSet, Wall Street was looking for Meta to report a daily active people (DAP) number of 3.31 billion.\nMeta's stock was still falling in after hours, and was down 2.67%.\nMeta said it expects to see greater operating losses in its Reality Labs business for 2024, due to ongoing product development and investments to further grow its ecosystem.\n\"We continue to expect 2024 operating losses to increase meaningfully year over year,\" Meta said in its press release.\nReality Labs, which develops the Metaverse, virtual reality headsets and glasses, reported a whopping loss of $4.4 billion in the third quarter, on revenue of $270 million.\nReality Labs has a loss of $12.8 billion, on revenue of $1 billion for the first nine months of 2024.\nMeta now expects $38 billion to $40 billion in capital spending this year, whereas the company's prior outlook called for $37 billion to $40 billion.\n\"Given this, along with the back-end weighted nature of our 2024 capital expenditures, we expect a significant acceleration in infrastructure expense growth next year as we recognize higher growth in depreciation and operating expenses of our expanded infrastructure fleet,\" the company said.\nThe company's outlook for total expenses is now $96 billion to $98 billion. Meta previously was projecting $96 billion to $99 billion.\nMeta Platforms Inc. is hiring in larger numbers again, as its headcount rose 9% in the third quarter.\nMeta said its headcount was 72,404 as of September 30.\nThat compares with 70,799 employees as of June 30, which was a decrease of 1% year over year.\nThe social-media giant has not had a rise in headcount for at least the last four quarters, after it did massive layoffs in 2022 and 2023, as it embarked on a year of efficiency.\nMeta\u2019s stock fell 1.2% in recent after-hours trading, even as profit beat expectations by a wide margin.\nNet income rose $15.69 billion, or $6.03 a share, from $11.58 billion, or $4.39 a share, in the same period a year ago. That was well above the FactSet EPS consensus of $5.22.\nRevenue climbed 19% to $40.59 billion, above the FactSet consensus of $40.21 billion.\nThe stock had closed the regular session down 0.3%, for the first loss in five sessions.\nMeta expects $45 billion to $48 billion in revenue for the fourth quarter, while analysts tracked by FactSet were expecting $46.2 billion.\nShares are down 2% in the extended session Wednesday.\nMeta has beaten sales estimates for eight quarters in a row and will be looking to keep the streak alive when it reports results after the close.\nThe biggest revenue beat in that stretch was by 3.5% in Meta's first-quarter report for 2023, while the smallest beat in the stretch was by 0.9% in the first quarter of this year.\nMeta has topped expectations for earnings per share in each of the past six quarters, beating by 2.4% to 20.5% over that span.",
