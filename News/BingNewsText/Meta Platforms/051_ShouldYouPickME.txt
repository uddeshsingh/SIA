    "maintext": "Meta stock (NASDAQ: META) has seen a 3% fall in a week, while it\u2019s up around 60% this year. The company recently reported its Q3 results, which were better than the street estimates. Its top line stood at $40.6 billion and the bottom line at $6.03, compared to the consensus estimates of $40.2 billion and $5.25, respectively. Despite a beat, the stock didn\u2019t see any gains, as investors were concerned about higher costs. Let\u2019s dive deeper into the company\u2019s quarterly performance and its impact on META stock. Also, look at what\u2019s happening with Google stock.\nHow Did Meta Fare In Q3?\nMeta Platforms\u2019 revenues of $40.6 billion in Q3 reflected a 19% y-o-y rise, driven by a 7% rise in ad impressions and an 11% growth in average price per ad. Meta also reported a 5% rise in family daily active people to 3.29 billion. Most of the company\u2019s revenue came from ad sales on Facebook, Instagram, Threads, and WhatsApp. The company is benefiting from its AI push, targeting more advertising. The company plans to use AI to generate more content.\nNot only did the company post higher revenues, its operating margin expanded to 43%, up around 300 bps y-o-y. Higher revenues and margin expansion resulted in earnings of $6.03 per share, up 37% y-o-y. Looking forward, Meta expects its Q4 revenue to be in the range of $45 billion to $48 billion.\nWhat didn\u2019t sit well with the investors was the company\u2019s hike in capital spending guidance to $38 billion to $40 billion and higher investments in 2025 as well. This compares with $27 billion Meta spent in capital expenditures in 2023. Much of the new investments are related to the company\u2019s AI push involving data centers and related infrastructure.\nWhat Does This Mean For META Stock?\nMETA stock, with 60% gains this year, has outperformed some of the other large tech stocks, including GOOG, up 21%, AMZN, up 28%, and MSFT, up 9%. However, we think META stock is appropriately priced now. We estimate Meta Platforms\u2019 valuation to be $560 per share, aligning with its current levels. At $560, META stock is already trading at 25x expected earnings of $22.65 in 2024, compared to the stock\u2019s average P/E ratio of 17x over the last three years. A rise in valuation multiple for META makes sense given the solid advertising growth lately. However, continued aggressive investments into AI also poses a slight risk if it would eventually provide a meaningful boost to the company\u2019s earnings growth. For now, the story for most of the tech stocks is about valuation multiples. Some of them are trading at levels higher than seen over recent years.\nAlthough META stock has seen a 2x rise since 2021, the increase has been far from consistent, with annual returns being considerably more volatile than the S&P 500. Returns for the stock were 23% in 2021, -64% in 2022, and 194% in 2023. In contrast, the Trefis High Quality Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, is considerably less volatile. And it has outperformed the S&P 500 each year over the same period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride, as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.\nWhile META stock looks appropriately priced, it is helpful to see how Meta\u2019s Peers fare on metrics that matter.
