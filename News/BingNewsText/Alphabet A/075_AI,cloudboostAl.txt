    "maintext": "Alphabet\u2019s profit jumped 34 percent in the third quarter as the parent company of search giant Google reported strong growth in its cloud business amid robust demand for computing and data services used to train and run generative artificial intelligence models.\nThe solid results released on Tuesday helped alleviate investors\u2019 fears about the financial returns on the vast sums being spent on AI by Alphabet and other Big Tech peers as they seek to dominate the nascent sector. The standout unit was Google Cloud, where revenue increased 35 percent to $11.4 billion and operating profit increased sevenfold to $1.9 billion from $266 million in the same period last year.\nNet income was $26.3 billion compared with $19.7 billion in the same period a year earlier, exceeding analysts\u2019 expectations for $22.8 billion. Revenue rose 15 percent to $88.3 billion in the three months through to the end of September, beating the average estimate for $86.3 billion.\n\u201cOur long-term focus and investment in AI [is] paying off,\u201d said chief executive Sundar Pichai, citing customer demand for its specialized clusters of chips and the growing popularity of its AI Overviews feature in search. \u201cWe continue to invest in state-of-the-art infrastructure to support our AI efforts, from the US to Thailand, to Uruguay.\u201d\nHowever, Google\u2019s cloud business remains a distant third to Microsoft\u2019s Azure and market leader Amazon Web Services, and competition is cut-throat. This week, Microsoft accused Google of running \u201cshadow campaigns\u201d and secretly funding lobby groups to undermine its position with regulators as it tries to poach customers and win market share.\nRevenue at Alphabet\u2019s core search and advertising businesses rose 10 percent to $65.9 billion. While the rate of growth slowed slightly, it showed little impact from AI chatbot challengers such as OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT.\nYouTube revenue rose 12 percent to $8.9 billion for the quarter\u2014and Google noted its ads and subscription sales surpassed $50 billion over the past four quarters for the first time as the platform expands into sports such as the National Football League.\n\u201cThe results show a strong beat across all segments, with notable strength in subscriptions and Cloud,\u201d said Jefferies analyst Brent Thill.\nAlphabet shares were up more than 6 percent in pre-market trading on Wednesday. The stock had previously gained 22 percent this year, giving it a market capitalization of $2.1 trillion and making it the fourth most-valuable listed company in the world behind Apple, Nvidia and Microsoft.\nGoogle is the first of Silicon Valley\u2019s tech giants to report earnings this quarter, and investors will be watching to see how much more money they have poured into data centers and advanced chips that power AI\u2014and whether any of those bets are starting to pay off.\nMicrosoft, Alphabet, Amazon, and Meta all revealed massive increases in capital expenditure in the first six months of 2024\u2014totaling $106 billion\u2014and executives pledged more investment this year and in 2025. The main beneficiary has been Nvidia, which briefly became the most valuable global company on the back of demand for its chips.\nAlphabet\u2019s capex rose again to $13.1 billion in the quarter, slightly more than in the prior three months and up 62 percent from the $8.1 billion spent in the same period last year.\nChief Financial Officer Anat Ashkenazi said the majority of that investment went toward infrastructure, which includes servers, chips, data centers, and networking equipment. Google will spend roughly the same amount in the fourth quarter, implying total spend of more than $50 billion this year, with that figure set to rise modestly again in 2025, she added.\nWhile Alphabet has shown strong earnings momentum this year, it faces threats on several fronts. A new generation of AI-powered chatbots such as ChatGPT and Anthropic\u2019s Claude are challenging its core search business. In response, Google has rolled out \u201cAI Overviews\u201d powered by its Gemini models at the top of results pages to provide direct answers to queries, rather than just a list of links.\nPichai said AI Overviews are gaining popularity with customers because of Gemini\u2019s ability to answer complex questions. Adverts are being integrated, and the computing costs of each query have dropped 90 percent in the past 18 months, he added.\nPichai also said Gemini was boosting internal productivity, with more than a quarter of all new code generated by AI, which is then reviewed and accepted by engineers.\nMore immediately, Google faces the prospect of being broken up after losing a landmark antitrust case brought by the US Department of Justice, which resulted in a ruling that determined its search business had engaged in anti-competitive monopolistic behavior. The company also lost an antitrust case against its Play app store brought by Fortnite developer Epic and faces a trial in a second DoJ case over its ad tech business.",
