    "maintext": "As fun as it is to go out on a date, deciding where to go or what to do can be the most annoying part. Some days, you may want something more chill and low maintenance; other days, you may want a really sexy date idea. But thanks to the new alphabet date challenge, you finally have more options than just the standard dinner and drinks.\nIf you've been anywhere near social media lately, then you're likely already familiar with how the alphabet date challenge works. It's what happens when each date idea is inspired by a different letter. Starting with the letter \"A\" and finishing with \"Z,\" couples work their way through the alphabet and let the letter decide their next date idea.\nThough these alphabet date ideas are a great way for couples to add some spontaneity to their routine, you don't have to be in a relationship to do the alphabet date challenge. Even if you don't have a significant other, go through the alphabet date ideas on your own or with a few different matches from a dating app until you've worked your way through 26 letters. (Pro tip: putting the alphabet date challenge in your Tinder bio or Hinge prompt may bring about some more matches.)\nIf you're up for the challenge, we've rounded up the best alphabet date ideas no matter what letter you're on.
