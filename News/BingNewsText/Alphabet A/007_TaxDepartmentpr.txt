I expect another projected increase will be difficult to hear,\u201d said Bolio. \u201cIt\u2019s important that we continue to work together to find solutions to make our education funding system sustainable.\"Last year's letter projected an 18.5% increase before the legislative session when it was in part brought down to 13.8% in the final version of the yield bill that was vetoed by Gov. Phil Scott, he was overridden in the veto session. Phil Baruth a Democrat and Senate pro tem, said in a statement, \"The news in this year's December 1st letter could have been much, much worse, but make no mistake: a 5.9% projected rise in property taxes next year would come on top of a nearly 14% rise this year, making for an average of double-digit increases in a world of high inflation more generally speaking,\" he said.
