    "maintext": "CEO Paul Bay Sunday wrote to employees that the company made the \u2018difficult\u2019 decision to lay off 850 employees over the next few months as part of a restructuring of its business aimed at optimizing costs and efficiency.\nIT distribution heavyweight Ingram Micro is eliminating about 850 of its employees with a planned layoff expected to be complete by the end of the first quarter of 2025.\nIngram Micro CEO Paul Bay unveiled the planned job cuts in a letter sent Sunday to Ingram Micro employees.\nIn the letter, a copy of which was reviewed by CRN, Bay wrote that Ingram Micro is undertaking a \u201cseries of restructuring activities\u201d across the company over the next three months that will result in the elimination of 850 employees.\n[Related: The 10 Biggest Tech Company Layoffs Of 2024 (So Far)]\nThe restructuring includes the integration of Ingram Micro\u2019s digital and information technology teams to reduce costs and eliminate redundancies, transforming the company\u2019s historical shared services model into an exception-based model, and streamlining selected country, business, and functional organizations.\n\u201cWe are committed to supporting affected associates through this transition and will provide more details regarding these benefits and payments through our local teams in the coming weeks. We understand that this news is difficult, and we want to acknowledge the valuable contributions of those who will be leaving Ingram Micro. These decisions are never easy, but they are necessary to position our organization for future success,\u201d Bay wrote.\nIngram Micro did not provide more information about the layoffs in response to a CRN inquiry.\nThis is not the first layoff for Ingram Micro, which in October became a public company after several years as a private company. The company early this year unveiled an unspecified number of layoffs, the latest in a series of layoff rounds. Ingram Micro later reported in a regulatory filing that 503 employees were let go at the time, and that it laid off an additional 606 employees in the 39 weeks ended September 30, 2023.\nIngram Micro in an October 2024 U.S. Securities and Exchange filing said it had over 24,100 full-time employees worldwide.\nMark Essayian, president of Irvine, Calif.-based KME Systems, an Ingram Micro partner, said while the layoffs are unfortunate, he\u2019s not surprised given that the company recently went public.\n\u201cPaul Bay is likely reviewing the company\u2019s financials every hour of the day to make critical decisions that protect both shareholders and the company\u2019s bottom line,\u201d Essayian told CRN. \"He\u2019s got to optimize it for shareholder risk now. The human element is real, almost [900] people are going to lose their job.\u201d\nHowever, Essayian said he believes Bay has proven he knows how to run a successful company and is making \u201cthese tough choices\u201d to ensure the business remains competitive.\nAnother Ingram Micro partner, James Rocker, CEO of Hauppauge, N.Y.-based MSP Nerds That Care, said he\u2019s cautiously optimistic that the layoffs would not significantly disrupt key relationships.\n\"I've built many strong friendships at Ingram, and while these layoffs are tough I don't foresee them affecting our ongoing collaborations,\" he told CRN. \"The relationships that drive the company\u2019s success, those critical partnerships, are likely to remain untouched.\"\nHe added that the ongoing transformation at Ingram Micro underscores the resilience and adaptability that have been \u201challmarks of the company's success.\u201d\n\"Given the volatility in the tech industry right now, and the pressures of being a publicly traded company, these kinds of cuts are likely part of a strategic shift toward greater operational efficiency,\u201d he said. \u201cTechnology companies are reinventing themselves, especially with AI and other operational advancements. Layoffs like these, while difficult, can be expected as firms adjust for long-term stability.\"\nFor its 2024 fiscal third quarter, which ended Sept. 28, Ingram Micro reported net sales of $11.8 billion with net income of $77 million, down from $11.9 billion in sales and $86.7 million in net income for the same period a year before.\nCJ Fairfield contributed to this article.",
