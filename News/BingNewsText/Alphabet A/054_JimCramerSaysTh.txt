    "maintext": "Additionally, Cramer suggested that there could be more significant market moves in the near future, especially if President-elect Trump makes comments about the Federal Reserve that investors find unsettling. He said that such remarks could trigger a negative reaction from the market, potentially leading to a downturn before things settle again.\nOur Methodology\nFor this article, we compiled a list of 16 stocks that were discussed by Jim Cramer during the episode of Mad Money on November 6 and listed the stocks in the order that Cramer mentioned them.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\nA user's hands typing a search query into a Google Search box, emphasizing the company's search capabilities.\nAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL)\nIn last week\u2019s episode of Mad Money, Cramer mentioned Alphabet Inc.\u2019s (NASDAQ:GOOGL) stock performance after the election results came in and the company\u2019s run-in with the antitrust authorities. Here\u2019s what he said:\n\u201cBig Tech got a real boost, especially the ones that have been hectored by antitrust like Alphabet or Amazon or, or frankly even Apple and maybe even, we thought maybe Nvidia and Meta\u2026\u201d\nAlphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL), the parent company of Google, was formed in 2015 following a major corporate restructuring. The company is currently facing significant legal challenges, primarily related to antitrust concerns. In 2020, the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) filed an antitrust lawsuit against it, accusing the company of engaging in monopolistic practices to maintain its dominance in online search.\nIn addition to the lawsuit, there have been signals from the DOJ suggesting that it could push for the breakup of Google, a move that would fundamentally change how the company operates. Among the potential actions being discussed is the termination of Google\u2019s payments to secure its default status on new devices, a practice that has played a key role in keeping the company at the top of the search engine market.\nThe ongoing legal battle could be influenced by political shifts. According to Reuters, experts have suggested that under a potential second term of Donald Trump, antitrust policies may change direction. The trial over the DOJ\u2019s proposed remedies will not take place until April 2025, with a final ruling expected by August of that year. This delay leaves the door open for potential shifts in the case's trajectory, as experts, such as William Kovacic, a law professor at George Washington University, suggest that a change in political leadership could influence how the DOJ handles Alphabet\u2019s (NASDAQ:GOOGL) case moving forward.\nOverall GOOGL ranks 9th on our list of the stocks Jim Cramer was talking about. While we acknowledge the potential of GOOGL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than GOOGL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\nREAD NEXT: 8 Best Wide Moat Stocks to Buy Now and 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock.",
