Most, if not all, politicians make promises that either they can\u2019t or won\u2019t keep.\nMy complaint isn\u2019t so much about Carnabucci as it is about LNP | LancasterOnline. In my view, this newspaper stopped being impartial a long time ago, but still wants to be considered a legitimate journalistic endeavor. Most of us know better.\nMost of this probably doesn\u2019t matter, since it appears that LNP | LancasterOnilne is about to become extinct or, at best, a small shell of itself. Can\u2019t say I\u2019m surprised or disappointed.\nDon Carson\nBrecknock Township",
