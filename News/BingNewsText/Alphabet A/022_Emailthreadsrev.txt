    "maintext": "WRENS, Ga. (WRDW/WAGT) - Email threads obtained by News 12 reveal how the city shakeup and resignation of former Wrens Police Chief John Maynard went down\nIn an email sent to all Wrens police department staff dated Oct. 28, Wrens City Manager Arty Thrift states, \" We are making some changes in our department involving personnel.\u201d\nThose changes included the voluntary resignation of former Assistant Police Chief Phillip Hambrick and Maynard being put on administrative leave.\nThis email did not mention a reason for the administrative leave or any specific details about the decision.\nHOW IT HAPPENED\nPublic records: What the emails tell us\nOn Nov. 1, an email with the subject \u201cWrongful Termination\u201d was sent by Maynard to Thrift. Maynard states Wrens Mayor David Hannah, \u201cmade several false allegations in a meeting,\u201d before requesting Maynard\u2019s resignation. \u201cI am not sure when nor why any meeting was called with council and has taken place concerning my employment, but it seems to me that the two reasons that I was given and even asked to resign, were all based and led by false information,\u201d Maynard wrote.\nOne of these two reasons for Maynard\u2019s resignation according to the emails was concerning his whereabouts during Hurricane Helene. Maynard states that he came to work on Sept. 26 around 10 a.m. and did not leave Wrens until Oct. 3rd at about 8:30 pm., according to the emails. \u201cAll of those nights in between, I slept in my office on a cot or a futon,\u201d Maynard Wrote.\nMaynard said even though he did work shifts at the mall, he still reported to work in Wrens for his normal shift. \u201cThe shifts that I worked at the mall were at night, protecting the linemen, their belongings and ensuring they were well rested to continue other restorations,\u201d Maynard wrote.\nMaynard concluded by stating he would be open to discussing his departure due to some \u201cother\u201d reasons. \u201cThis is the highest injustice for anyone, much less for someone who has sacrificed so much for the city, including sending his own family away so that I could stay and work for the City of Wrens during the worst storm ever recorded in our state\u2019s history,\u201d Maynard wrote.\nIn another email sent to Thrift, also dated Nov. 1, Maynard alleges that an hour-long meeting was held on Oct. 2 by the Mayor discussing Maynard\u2019s employment, without him present. \u201cThe mayor is also acting as the council, mayor, city administrator and police chief by having secret meetings at his home with police officers.\u201d\nIn the final thread of emails dated Nov. 4, Maynard states: \u201cI understand I have two options. Resign or be terminated. But can I not have a reason or grounds for the termination?\u201d Thrift\u2019s response: \u201cWe both agree it is not working out in Wrens. As such, I am offering you an option to resign your position and we both go our separate ways. If you choose not to resign, then I will issue a termination of employment letter. The termination letter is going look very different than the courtesy meeting you had with Mayor Hannah. I need to move forward on behalf of the citizens and businesses of Wrens and the staff here. Please let me know your decision.\u201d\nMaynard sent his letter of resignation on Nov. 4.\nIn Maynard\u2019s letter, he offers a two-week standard resignation but asks for it to be accepted effective immediately. It was put into effect that day, according to the files.\nWhile the cause of this resignation is still uncertain, documents show Maynard received overall good reviews in his performance evaluations.\nMaynard was recommended for several salary increases based on his performance, according to the files.\nIn one review dated May 2022, it states Maynard is \u201cImproving with training,\u201d and that \u201cdepartment-wide productivity has improved.\u201d\nAnother from January 2024 mentions problems within the department stating: \u201cChief had a good department that is slipping. The chief is working through some staff and departmental issues. Needs to build confidence and morale back up in the department...Need more of the chief\u2019s presence, guidance and input.\u201d\nFour months later in May, Maynard received a follow-up. This review mentioned improvements in the police department but echoed previous statements of \u201clots of work to be done.\u201d\nThe salary increase was still recommended.\nAlso included in the files was a separation notice. This document listed the circumstances of his separation as a \u201cvoluntary resignation.\u201d\nFormer Ga. poll worker indicted over bomb threat to polling place\nA former Georgia poll worker was indicted Tuesday for allegedly threatening to bomb a polling place and lying to the FBI during the investigation.\nHambrick also offered his resignation in a letter dated Oct. 29.\nIn the letter, Hambrick states his resignation as a part-time lieutenant is due to wanting to focus on his full-time job and his family.\nAccording to the resignation, Hambrick stated: \u201cI truly enjoyed my time with the city of Wrens and have had the opportunity to work alongside some great folks. I feel during my time with the city, I have made a positive impact and developed bonds with her community and staff that will be forever recognized.\u201d\nHambricks resignation was also made effective Nov. 4\nHis separation notice also listed the circumstances as a \u201cvoluntary separation\u201d.\nMaynard told News 12 on Friday: \u201cI am still praying about my direction on handling this situation as well as where I go from here. I was given an ultimatum, but I did nothing criminally wrong as some rumors suggest. I was equally surprised, but I trust God in everything.\u201d\nCopyright 2024 WRDW/WAGT. All rights reserved.",
