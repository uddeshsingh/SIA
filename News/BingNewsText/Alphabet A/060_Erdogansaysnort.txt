    "maintext": "Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan on Wednesday night said the north is \u201cready\u201d to transition to the new common Turkic alphabet.\nAddressing the Organisation of Turkic States (OTS) summit in the Kyrgyz capital city Bishkek, he said the new alphabet will \u201cunite the Turkic world\u201d, and called on all OTS members to transition from their current alphabets to the new one.\n\u201cTurkey, Azerbaijan, and the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus are ready in this regard. It would be appropriate for Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Uzbekistan, and Turkmenistan to take the initiative to switch to the new alphabet,\u201d he said.\nPlans for a common Turkic alphabet have been suggested since the collapse of the Soviet Union in the early 1990s, with Azerbaijan having briefly adopted an earlier form of a common Turkic alphabet in December 1991.\nHowever, the country then reformed its alphabet a year later, and has since used an alphabet of its own, with minor differences.\nThe initiative to introduce a common Turkic alphabet then gathered pace this year at a meeting of the Turkic World Common Alphabet Commission in Azerbaijan\u2019s capital city Baku, where a consensus was reached on a 34-letter alphabet.\nThe alphabet contains all 29 letters which have been used in Turkish since Mustafa Kemal Ataturk\u2019s reforms in 1928, plus five others.\nNot everyone in the north was enamoured with Erdogan\u2019s insistence that the north is ready to transition, however, with Turkish Cypriot Nicosia mayor Mehmet Harmanci issuing a sarcastic response on social media.\n\u201cIt is a relief to know that we are ready for this, and education scientists and linguists will surely now receive the reward for all the academic studies they have been carrying out for days and months,\u201d he began.\nHe added, \u201cthis magnificently planned and programmed development of this country\u2019s education sector excites us all. Of course, the response to this will be, \u2018are we removing letters from the alphabet, did you find it hard to add five new letters, you enemies of the state?\u2019 You are super!\u201d\nTeachers\u2019 trade union Ktoeos were also less than amused by Erdogan\u2019s announcement, taking aim at the north\u2019s \u2018government\u2019s\u2019 insistence that it is a \u201csovereign, equal state\u201d.\n\u201cWhere are you, those who claim to be a sovereign, equal state? Your hat fell off and you are bald again! Stop chewing this phrase like gum. You are neither equal, nor sovereign, nor independent, nor free,\u201d the union began.\nIt then asked, \u201cdid you hear that you approved the participation in a project of which not even you education minister was aware? You do not need to be aware of it, you can continue your game of democracy or playing the game of playing for chairs in parliament,\u201d briefly referring to the ongoing crisis over the functioning of the north\u2019s \u2018parliament\u2019.\n\u201cOnce again, it was revealed that half of this island is lower management and everything is a theatre play performed by puppets. It has once again been brought to society\u2019s attention that policies in all areas \u2013 political, economic cultural, social, education, health \u2013 are produced by the upper management and implemented by the puppets they appoint here,\u201d it said.\n\u201cOnce again, we have seen who the creator of this swamp system is, which was created with fraud, corruption, illegality, bribery, and favouritism, and who planned to take away the political will of the Turkish Cypriots and bring them to the point of extinction!\u201d",
