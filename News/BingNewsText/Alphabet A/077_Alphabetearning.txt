    "maintext": "Alphabet's prior report offered some puts and takes, but the company was an \"all-around winner\" in the latest quarter, with all segments coming in ahead of revenue expectations.\nThat's according to Jefferies analyst Brent Thill, who wrote that AI \"feels increasingly like a well-managed tailwind\" for the Google parent company.\nAI helped drive a big acceleration in Google Cloud revenue. Growth for that unit amounted to 35%, which compares with 29% growth in the second quarter and 28% growth in the first quarter.\nAlphabet's latest earnings demonstrated \"the company\u2019s continued leadership in the AI era, helping to address one key element of the bear case around the company\u2019s 'terminal' value,\" according to Evercore ISI analyst Mark Mahaney.\nHe thinks the company \"appears to be making solid progress in bending the AI cost curve,\" as shown by a 90% drop in the machine cost per query over the past 18 months when it comes to AI Overviews in search.\nMahaney also flagged that Alphabet is adding new advertising options for AI Overviews in the U.S. \"We would like to see more quantification, but the trends seem clearly positive,\" he wrote.\nAlphabet's stock rose 5.8% in extended trading Tuesday, and attention will now move to the other large technology names on this week's docket.\nMeta will offer another read on advertising spending Wednesday afternoon, while Microsoft will give its view of cloud spending.\nAmazon, which plays into both advertising and the cloud, reports on Thursday afternoon, along with Apple.\nAI is impacting Alphabet's business in a number of visible ways, according to William Blair analyst Ralph Schackart.\nHe highlighted AI's effect on the cloud business, for one. \"The company\u2019s technology leadership and broad AI portfolio have helped it attract new cloud customers, as it has won both larger deals and achieved 30% deeper product adoption among its existing customer base,\" Schackart wrote.\nAdditionally, marketers using AI-powered functions are seeing better traffic and click-through metrics, he noted.\nAlphabet posted a big positive surprise on Google Cloud revenue, but its margin expansion of 17% for the segment garnered some attention on the earnings call.\n\"Obviously, as we scale the business, we have more opportunity for margin expansion,\" CFO Anat Ashkenazi said. \"But the second [thing, which] shouldn't be underestimated is the work the team has done to drive efficiencies across the cloud business.\"\nThis came in response to a question from Evercore analyst Mark Mahaney, who asked about Alphabet's confidence in its ability to get cloud margins near those of larger peers, in the realm of 30%.\nSearch is a massive business for Alphabet. So Wall Street has been wondering how the AI revolution will impact this powerhouse.\nSpecifically, advertising has been lucrative within the Google search engine, but analysts have questioned whether AI search will be the same sort of moneymaker.\nAlphabet executives addressed this topic on the earnings call, saying that early AI monetization efforts are showing traction. \"The transition here is working well, including for ads,\" Chief Business Officer Philipp Schindler said.\nWith AI Overviews for search, Google sees \"monetization at approximately the same rate, which gives us a really strong base on which we can innovate,\" he added.\nAlphabet shelled out $13 billion on capital expenditures in the third quarter, and CFO Anat Ashkenazi says to expect a similar level in the current quarter.\nThe company sees big potential to capitalize on the AI trend, but it has to spend up to achieve its vision, according to management.\n\"Realizing those opportunities and great innovation in AI requires global reach, which we have through our products at platforms, as well as continued meaningful capital investment,\" Ashkenazi said. \"And while we have a strong balance sheet to be able to support these investments, we will be looking for efficiencies so that we can fund innovation in priority areas.\"\nYouTube is benefiting from \"robust growth in watch time,\" according to Anat Ashkenazi, the company's new CFO.\nThe company also highlighted ways that AI is helping YouTube. For instance, Google is using AI to improve recommendations and develop a deeper understanding of the content in videos.\nGoogle is seeing traction with short-form video as well, with new options for advertisers as well as new functionality that lets people upload \"Shorts\" that are up to three minutes long.\nGoogle's upbeat performance in the cloud is helping to lift shares of its rivals.\nMicrosoft's stock is up 0.8% in the extended session, while Amazon's is up 1.2%. Those two companies report Wednesday and Thursday, respectively.\nGoogle's accelerating cloud growth of 35% \"should be a solid positive read-thru to other cloud names,\" Evercore ISI analyst Mark Mahaney wrote. He also thought the results serve as a \"modest positive\" to other advertising names. Meta's stock is up about 1% in the extended session, ahead of the Facebook parent's own report Wednesday afternoon.\nCEO Sundar Pichai says Google is seeing growing adoption of AI-driven search. That's helped in part by a new Circle to Search feature for Android users that lets people search without leaving the app they're in.\n\"This leads to users coming to search more often for more of their information needs, driving additional search queries,\" he said on the earnings call.\nGoogle also highlighted particular traction with younger users when it comes to AI search.",
