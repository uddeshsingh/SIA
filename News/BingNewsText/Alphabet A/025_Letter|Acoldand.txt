    "description": "More than a year ago I went with my family to the brunch at Chaminade for Easter. It was terrific. So when I saw an ad in the Sentinel for Thanksgiving dinner at Chaminade I signed up for six adults and one child. When we arrived at 4:15, we were shown to our table outside [\u2026]",

    "maintext": "More than a year ago I went with my family to the brunch at Chaminade for Easter. It was terrific. So when I saw an ad in the Sentinel for Thanksgiving dinner at Chaminade I signed up for six adults and one child. When we arrived at 4:15, we were shown to our table outside with a heater at one end of the table for 12. I quickly realized it would be too cold to sit outside comfortably. I was told that there were no indoor tables available. I tried to get some food but many of the stations were running out and could only come up with a small piece of turkey and some mashed potatoes. Finally I went in search for a manager. She asked my party what they wanted. My sister-in-law said another heater would help. Meanwhile the family next to us had managed to get blankets which they were wrapping around themselves. By this point we were pretty much done and ready to leave.\nWe spent over $700 to shiver on our cold plastic chairs.\n\u2014 Margaret Kinstler, Soquel\nThe Sentinel welcomes your letters to the editor.
