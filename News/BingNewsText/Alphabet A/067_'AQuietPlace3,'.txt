    "maintext": "\"A Quiet Place 3\" is still in the works, and no we aren't talking about the spin-off prequel \"A Quiet Place: Day One\" that premiered in theaters over the summer. Continuing the story of a world overrun by terrifying alien creatures that hunt by sound, the next main entry could potentially pick up with Emily Blunt in the lead, but whether John Krasinski will return as director remains uncertain.\nThere\u2019s also the possibility that \u201cA Quiet Place 3\u201d could introduce new characters in a different location, still under siege from the same breed of marauding predators from the OG films. At this point, though, details about the plot are still unclear.\nInitially, \"A Quiet Place 3\" was scheduled to release sometime in 2025, but it's since been delayed indefinitely. With no official explanation yet provided, fans are eagerly awaiting further updates. That being said, we have gotten word on another potential project set in the same universe, though: \"Day One\" director Michael Sarnoski told Variety in July 2024 that we could see a \"Day Two\" style follow-up to the prequel story.\nHere's a rundown of everything we know about \"A Quiet Place 3\" and the future of the franchise.\n\"A Quiet Place: Day One\" hit theaters on June 28, beating box office records for the series and grossing $138 million domestically and $122 million globally.\n\"A Quiet Place: Day One\" became available to stream on Paramount Plus on August 27.\n\"A Quiet Place Part III\" was originally slated to release in 2025 but has been delayed indefinitely.\n\"A Quiet Place: Day One\" director Michael Sarnoski says a sequel is \"absolutely\" happening in a July Variety interview.\nWhat we know about 'A Quiet Place: Day One'\nThe franchise's first spinoff, \"A Quiet Place: Day One\" made its theatrical debut on June 28 and stars a brand-new cast of characters. The first official trailer debuted in February, followed by a more in-depth trailer (which you can check out below) in May.\nWith a new story developed by Krasinski and \"Day One\" writer-director Michael Sarnoski, this movie takes us back to the first chaotic moments following the alien invasion. It's something we got a brief glimpse of in the opening flashback sequence of \"A Quiet Place: Part II,\" but \"Day One\" explores the fallout more in-depth and gives us an idea of how people survived in those early days before the aliens' sensitivities to sound was as well understood.\nOscar winner Lupita Nyong\u2019o plays a terminally ill poet named Sam on a day trip to New York City when the monsters arrive. When everything goes to hell, she is thrown together with a fellow survivor named Eric (played by \"Stranger Things'\" Joseph Quinn) and the two team up to try to navigate the chaos. The latest trailer shows the two planning an escape route only to see government jets bomb the bridges leading out of Manhattan, presumably to keep the monsters overrunning the city from reaching the mainland.\nOne familiar character returns as well. Djimon Hounsou, who appeared in \"A Quiet Place Part II\" as the unnamed leader of a small island colony of survivors, reprises his role in \"Day One.\"\n\"A Quiet Place: Day One\" enjoyed a $53 million opening weekend in the U.S. \u2014 the best the series has seen yet. Critics were more divided, with it currently sitting at an 85% rating on Rotten Tomatoes, lower than both the original \"A Quiet Place\" (96%) and \"A Quiet Place Part Two\" (91%), with some complaining the prequel doesn't add much new lore about the monsters or their invasion. All told, \"A Quiet Place: Day One\" grossed over $260 million during its theatrical run.\n\"A Quiet Place: Day One\" director Michael Sarnoski told Variety in July 2024 that a sequel could \"absolutely\" be in the cards\u2014though it remains to be seen whether there's anything concrete to back this up beyond his own enthusiasm.\n\"At this point, I\u2019m just recovering from making this one,\" he told the outlet. \"So I\u2019m sure Paramount will come up with something very fun next.\"\nWhere can I stream 'A Quiet Place: Day One'?\nThe prequel made its streaming debut on Paramount Plus on August 27. You can also buy or rent \"A Quiet Place: Day One\" on Amazon. Check out our Paramount Plus review for a breakdown of all the streamer's different tiers, bundles with Showtime, and more.\n\"A Quiet Place 3\" does not yet have a release date. Back in 2022, Paramount Plus revealed it was targeting a 2025 release window. Paramount Plus tweeted at the time: \"The next installment of @quietplacemovie is coming next year & will be directed by Michael Sarnoski. And, #AQuietPlace Part III is coming in 2025.\" (We later learned that \"next installment\" was about \"Day One.\")\nThen in February 2024, the studio announced development had been delayed indefinitely. No new release date has been announced, but with filming yet to begin, it's not likely to be any time soon.\n'A Quiet Place 3' cast\nDetails are thin for \"A Quiet Place 3.\" No cast members have been confirmed.\nIt's possible that the main players of \"A Quiet Place 2\" return: Emily Blunt as Evelyn Abbott, Millicent Simmonds as Regan Abbott, and Noah Jupe as Marcus Abbott. A flashback cameo may be made by John Krasinski as Lee Abbott.\n'A Quiet Place 3' plot\nMuch of what happens in \"A Quiet Place 3\" will likely rely on how this movie interlinks with the world of the previous two films.\n\"A Quiet Place 2\" focused on Regan Abbott's quest to find the source of a mysterious radio signal, which played \"Beyond the Sea\" on a strange loop. She finds an island that is actually a safe haven for humans as the aliens cannot swim; the National Guard rounded up people in the early days of the apocalyptic invasion to safely stow them away from the monsters. Except a monster does eventually arrive, because of course it does.\nThere are any number of places a new story could go.\nBlunt told Collider that Krasinski has plenty of ideas for both a sequel to the Abbott family and for a tangential film, explaining that he \u201cwanted to see how people responded to this one (\"A Quiet Place 2\") before he fully engaged his brain on the third one. But he has a couple of great ideas.\u201d\nIn an interview with Empire, Krasinski teased, \"Is it going to continue the Abbotts? Who knows!... No, I will tell you that it is\u2026 I\u2019m really excited about the third installment because it\u2019s going to do something that we haven\u2019t done before.\"\nWhich is a lot of words to not say anything at all. That said, he did give us something real to chew on, speaking of the end of \"Part 2\": \"The ending of the last shot is, now that the world knows about [the signal that the creatures are vulnerable to], what will the world do with this answer, or with this weapon? Will they be responsible with it, or will they not be responsible with it?\u201d",
