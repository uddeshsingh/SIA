    "maintext": "The break-in happened in broad daylight. On Nov. 9, a local Asian business owner watched in horror as their Ring security camera captured two individuals walking out of their family home near 39th Avenue and Willamette Street in Eugene. Speaking a foreign language, the suspects flagged down a waiting white car with a safe slung over their shoulder. Inside the safe: cash, heirloom jewelry, social security documents, and other personal items.\nA neighbor, who witnessed the burglary, called 911 and tried to track the direction of the getaway car. But, according to the business owner, Eugene police didn\u2019t arrive until three hours later to take statements and snap a few photos.\nNow, the family is left grappling with more than material losses.\n\"We've literally been sleeping with a baseball bat next to each of us,\" the family member of the local business owner told The Register-Guard on the condition of anonymity. \"My family has lived here for over 30 years and nothing like this has happened to us. It feels very violating.\"\nA string of burglaries across Oregon and a perceived lack of response from law enforcement agencies prompted a letter from members of the Asian community in Eugene demanding action from state and local officials.\nThe letter, distributed on Nov. 18, says the \"rise in crimes targeting Asians is well-documented, but the response from authorities and law enforcement has not reflected the allyship it claims.\"\nOver 100 people, including organizations like the Asia Pacific Advanced Network, have signed the letter.\n\"The authorities have not alerted Asian families in the area about these ongoing burglaries, and even when Asian families who have been burglarized are providing tangible, real-time evidence, the authorities are not taking timely action,\" the letter said.\nIn Eugene, the police department says there are at least seven cases connected locally to a multistate burglary ring targeting mostly Asian households owned by business owners and other professionals.\n\"The burglars have stolen safes and appear to have screen/surveilled their potential victims, then broken into the homes while the victims are at work,\" Eugene police officials said.\nAn Oregon State Police spokesperson says they are unaware of cases troopers are involved in related to the burglary ring.\nNot the first time targeted burglaries have been reported in Eugene\nThe Eugene Police Department property crimes unit said officers conducted six simultaneous arrests on June 23 in three residential neighborhoods, including North Delta Highway and Ayres Road, Franklin Blvd. and Agate Street, and in the 700 block of E. 15th Ave.\nAt the time, Eugene police said the burglaries often began with a female suspect approaching the residence and casually knocking on the door. The suspects would try to \"blend in\" by wearing construction vests, Amazon delivery vests, and scrubs.\nOf the six people arrested, three were charged and arraigned in court on June 25, while the other three were released from police custody.\nMaria Castro-Cortes was charged with first-degree attempted burglary for her involvement in a home invasion near Brewer Ave. and Shiloh Street in Eugene; John Vasquez and his reported accomplice, Emmanuel Figuera were each arraigned on one count of first-degree burglary and first-degree attempted burglary.\nAll three suspects posted bail not too soon after their arrests \u2014 Castro-Cortes posted $5,000, while Vasquez and Figuera each posted $10,000.\nAfter they were released from custody, Lane County Circuit Court Judge Erin Fennerty issued bench warrants for each of their arrests and revoked their security release agreements on July 31 for failure to appear for their 35-day calls. As of Monday, those warrants were still in place.\nOther robbery incidents reported in Oregon, other states\nTan Boon's family owns a Thai restaurant in Grants Pass.\nIn Dec. 2023, Boon's mother left her home to go to the gym when a blue van drove up to her house. Two individuals wearing what appeared to be white Tyvek suits, work boots, and gloves, broke in through a window, went to the primary bedroom, and stole a safe out of the closet. The safe, similar to that of the business owner in Eugene, contained thousands of dollars worth of heirloom jewelry, gold bars, watches, personal documents, deeds to the house, and more.\nThough the family claims the Grants Pass Police Department responded to the scene within 30 minutes of the 911 call, communication about the subsequent investigation and potential arrests has been lackluster.\n\"We have pretty much lost faith in the police because they haven't really done much to \u2026 they didn't warn us or anything. It's been really different after the incident and now my mom wants to move out of the house because she does not feel safe in that neighborhood anymore,\" Boon said. \"We're worried because they have the address of other homes in the safe so they could come back.\"\nBoon told The Register-Guard that the incident had caused distrust among community members who questioned how the robbers knew where the safe was located.\n\"We were looking back to who may have known about the safe and so it's just based on confusion,\" Boon said.\nNearly a year after the robbery, Boon is still concerned about his family's safety. At his own home, he's installed security cameras and an alarm system in case it's targeted.\n\"They can come back to my house at any night,\" Boon said. \"I'm kind of always looking over my shoulder, which is so strange.\"\nA quick Google search about the burglary ring will bring up dozens of stories on community concerns, arrests, court hearings, and more.\nIn August, Komo News reported that prosecutors with the U.S. Attorney's Office in Seattle filed charges against two men accused of targeting Asian families throughout western Washington in a series of \"violent home-invasion robberies and a murder in the summer of 2022.\"\nIn October, CBS News reported burglary crews were targeting the homes of Asian business owners in Colorado stealing massive amounts of cash, jewelry, watches, and high-end purses in what one detective called an \"epidemic.\"\nKOIN News in Portland recently reported at least 10 incidents tied to the burglary ring have occurred in Washington County, Oregon. Four have taken place in Tigard, two in Beaverton, and four in other parts of the county.\nEugene police advise simple, costly solutions\nPolice officials advise residents to not keep large amounts of cash and valuables at home, consider placing any large cash stores at a financial institution and consider insuring expensive items.\nThe Eugene Police Department Community Team offers additional tips and costly solutions:\nLock all windows and doors. Use deadbolts on doors that have them.\nInstall surveillance cameras that will notify you of criminal activity.\nUse timers on TVs and lights while away.\nClose blinds when away from home and leave exterior lights on at night.\nMake the home appear occupied when away or arrange to have someone stay at your house while gone.\nDon't store large amounts of cash at home. Some criminals have been known to work together and steal large safes. If you have a safe, ensure it is mounted properly and securely.\nBe aware of suspicious persons or vehicles around your neighborhood or at your place of business.\nSchedule a free Home Vacation Check while away.\nSchedule a Home Safety Assessment with the Eugene Police Department's Community Engagement Team at https://www.eugene-or.gov/944/Community-Engagement-Team.\nAsian community demands answers\nIn the Nov. 18 letter addressed to Oregon leaders, Asian community members said that in order to create an environment where everyone feels safe, protected, and valued, authorities should take proactive and concrete actions surrounding response times for targeted crimes, tracking and reporting such crimes, and pursuing justice for those affected.\n\"We must bring attention to these targeted crimes and demand accountability from our officials and the authorities,\" the letter said. \"We ask: How many more of us have to be stalked, surveilled, and targeted before officials think we're worth protecting?\"",
