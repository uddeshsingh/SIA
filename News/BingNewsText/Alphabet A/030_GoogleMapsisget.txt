And if the incident or obstacle is gone, you can let the app know so it's no longer warning other motorists.\nWhy Waze is worth waiting for\nGoogle's parent, Alphabet, has owned Waze since 2013, and it's kept the app as a Maps alternative for all that time. But that's finally changing, and I for one can't wait.\nI think the best way to put it is that Google Maps is by far the better driving app, but Waze is by far the better app for telling you about trouble. Unfortunately it's also \u2013 to my eyes \u2013 absolutely hideous and rather child-like in its design. So integrating Waze into Maps is a very welcome upgrade.\nAs 9to5Google reports, users are starting to see Waze information in Google Maps on their phones and also in Android Auto.\nThe examples we've seen so far are from users warning about police speed traps, which appear as an information banner in the main Maps interface: \"Police reported ahead. From Waze drivers. Are they still there?\"\nAs welcome as the integration is, there does appear to be some confusion over when the notifications and reporting options actually started. While the 9to5Google story is based on a Reddit report from this week, many users have replied to say they've been receiving Waze alerts for a month or more.\nThe confusion may simply be because this is a slow rollout.",
