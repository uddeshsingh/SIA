    "maintext": "Florida State football fans are dejected, exasperated, hurting and angry.\nTheir Seminoles tumbled to 1-8 after dropping their fifth straight game in Saturday's 35-11 home defeat to North Carolina. With each defeat, the program sinks deeper into historic oblivion.\nOne diehard FSU fan, however, is encouraging other Seminoles to send positive vibes to coach Mike Norvell in a letter writing campaign.\nMark Zeigler, a popular senior lecturer and director of experience programs in Business Career Services at FSU's College of Business, penned a letter of encouragement as an 8-year-old third grader in 1973 to FSU coach Larry Jones.\nJones, whose team finished 0-11 and remains the lone winless team in school history dating back to 1954, responded to Zeigler. In a typed-written letter, Jones thanked Zeigler and said \"we certainly appreciate having fans like you.\" Jones added he had an 8-year-old son and \"he loves Florida State, too.\"\nZeigler shared Jones' letter on social media, pointing out that's \"easy to complain\" and he suspected FSU coach Mike Norvell could use a nice letter right now. He told the Tallahasee Democrat, \"I remember like yesterday what it felt like\" when he received Jones' letter in the mail.\n\"I am trying,\" Zeigler told the Tallahassee Democrat.\n\"I am angry, sad, disappointed. I think I feel that way because I like Norvell so much and believe in his values and what he is trying to instill in these young men. Doing my best to stay positive. Letters and positive posts is how I try to handle it. I always want to be part of the solution.\"\nStruggling FSU football needs all the encouragement it can get\nThe last FSU team to finish with just one win was in 1974, when the Seminoles went 1-10 under Darrell Mudra. The 1973 Seminoles were a tick worse at 0-10 under Jones.\nSince 1975, FSU has won five or less games just four times. On the flip side, that span features 26 seasons with double-digit victories and three national titles - two under Bobby Bowden (1993 and 1999) and one under Jimbo Fisher (2013).\nUNC coach Mack Brown, a former FSU player and assistant, won his first game against FSU as a coach in 12 games.\n\"I do think Coach Bowden was a dear friend,\" Brown said after the game. \"I think he's in heaven tonight with a smile on his face, even though Florida State lost. He knows that I love him and I love this place. They've been really, really good to me, and it is good to come here and win.\"\nAfter finishing the regular season last year at 13-0 and entering 2024 ranked 10th in the preseason polls, not much has gone right for FSU and Norvell. Their lone win was a 14-9 home win over Cal. The Seminoles close out their season at Notre Dame Saturday and at home against Charleston Southern (Nov. 23) and Florida (Nov. 30).\nIn his postgame news conference Saturday, an intense, adamant Norvell said he still believes in his team and believes he can straighten out the mess. He said his confidence is unwavering.\n\"I've seen the highs and lows in the game of football, and hell, in the game of life, just to be honest with you, \" Norvell said. \"I know and believe in what can be done, how it can be done. I don't need a motivational speech, or even an encouraging word. I don't care. It doesn't matter to me.\n\"I know what it needs to look like. I know how you need to work. I know how you need to apply the lessons that are learned, and I damn sure know that I can do that. And I know that I can put together a team and a group that absolutely can respond to that. And we have not done a good enough job of that, and I do believe in those players in there.\"\nSue Hall, a former administrative assistant for legendary Bowden, also said she recently penned a letter of support and encouragement to Norvell.\n\"Yes, I hurt for the team and coaches and for our fans,\" Hall said. \"I go to games and will not give up on them.\"\nWant to mail the coach?\nZeigler says you can mail letters to\nMike Norvell403 Stadium Drive West Tallahassee, FL 32306",
