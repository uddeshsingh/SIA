    "maintext": "Executive life empowerment coach, Pirie Jones Grossman Coaching.\nI\u2019ve walked through many seasons of life, both personally and professionally. The generation I was born in, the Baby Boomer generation, shaped a large part of my experiences.\nNow, Gen-Z is the youngest generation in the workforce. As the mother of two Gen-Z children and the life empowerment coach of a few Gen-Z clients, I\u2019ve seen firsthand the unique opportunities and challenges this generation faces. I believe in the resilience and capability of my children, my Gen-Z clients and all Gen-Zers to leverage great opportunities and navigate the challenges in front of them. When I meet Gen-Zers, I often reflect on what I wish I\u2019d known when I was their age and advancing my career. If you\u2019re a Gen-Zer, here\u2019s my letter of advice to you.\nBe Patient With Yourself\nFirst, be patient with yourself. Many parts of life today revolve around instant gratification, and it\u2019s easy to feel pressure to have it all together now. But as I remind my kids, life isn\u2019t a race. You may want something immediately, but it\u2019s not possible to achieve everything you want whenever you want to. Many of the best things in life take time.\nAs you work toward your goals, be patient with yourself. By doing so, you\u2019ll find it\u2019s easier to be patient with others, too. Patience is an especially important skill in the workplace, where different generations with varying communication styles frequently have to interact.\nDon\u2019t Rely On External Validation\nWhile praise from others, especially in the workplace, can feel great, you shouldn\u2019t rely on external validation.\nSomething I\u2019ve learned in life is not to wait for others to appreciate you. Whether it\u2019s in your personal or professional life, you should learn to appreciate yourself first. Rather than putting yourself \u201cup for a vote,\u201d learn how to celebrate and recognize your own strengths, successes and failures.\nSeek Work-Life Balance\u2014But Be Mindful About How You Frame It\nThese days, It can seem like everyone around you is \u201chustling,\u201d trying to rapidly advance in life. Work-life balance is important. When I was starting my career, work-life balance wasn\u2019t really emphasized. But I\u2019ve noticed that many in your generation embrace this concept\u2014which is great. By taking care of your well-being first, especially your mental health, you can be a better employee, friend and relative.\nBut like most things in life, how you express it is key. If you have a demanding tone and tell your manager that you\u2019ll only work so many hours and only do so many tasks, then you risk coming across as entitled. Your manager might be from my generation, and we grew up in a different professional world. Both generations need to adjust to each other; it\u2019s a two-way street. If you approach conversations about work-life balance and boundaries with a good attitude, use the right tone and take a collaborative approach, you\u2019ll likely get better outcomes. Consider framing your requests in this manner: \u201cI\u2019d like to perform my best at work, and to do so, I need some time to unplug. Could we brainstorm a solution that works for both of us?\u201d\nPrioritize Connecting With People Face-To-Face\nWe live in a digital age, and technology enables us to stay in touch with each other. But a lot of things can get lost in translation over text, email and work messaging platforms.\nPrioritize connecting with the people in your life face-to-face, whether in person or over video calls. In my view, face-to-face interactions are the best way to have meaningful conversations and build authentic relationships. They remind us of the humanity in our connections.\nFind And Respectfully Use Your Authentic Voice\nWhat is an authentic voice? This is your true self\u2019s voice that expresses your thoughts, values and feelings honestly without trying to conform to what others expect. With your authentic voice, you\u2019ll be able to speak up in a way that reflects who you are while staying respectful and genuine. Finding and respectfully using your authentic voice during this critical stage of your life will give you inner peace and confidence because you\u2019ll be able to express yourself truthfully. Finding your authentic voice as a Gen-Zer requires self-reflection and being open to exploring who you truly are beyond the noise of peer pressure, social media noise and societal pressures. Pay attention to what excites or bothers you, and take notes of the thoughts and values that feel right, even if they\u2019re unpopular. Spend time alone to understand and know your beliefs and values, then practice expressing your opinions in small, safe settings. You\u2019ll start refining how you communicate what matters most to you.\nYour authentic voice is one of the most powerful tools you have. It\u2019s crucial for being able to maintain your mental and emotional health.\nRecognize Your Power\nWhen we\u2019re young, it can be easy to fall into the trap of blaming people and external circumstances for the situations we find ourselves in.\nBut one of the most transformative lessons I\u2019ve learned is that you aren\u2019t a victim of your life. The sooner you embrace this truth, the more empowered you will feel. When things don\u2019t go as you planned or hoped, you\u2019ll be able to take action rather than fall into a loop of self-doubt, imposter syndrome and/or inaction. Recognize your power to make yourself happy and successful.\nBalance Your Passion For Innovation And Change With The Wisdom Of Patience And Relationship-Building\nI\u2019ve observed that many Gen-Zers are passionate about innovation and change, yet that passion isn\u2019t always communicated productively. Many of my Baby Boomer coaching clients in hiring roles have shared this observation with me.\nBalance your passion for innovation and change with the wisdom of patience and relationship-building. The fresh ideas you bring to the table are crucial, but true innovation and change stem from collaboration. Approach the need for innovation and change with understanding. Respect your colleagues\u2019 experiences and use your emotional intelligence to navigate the different personalities and work styles. Remember, change and innovation don\u2019t happen overnight. Rather than seeking immediate results, focus on being patient and making incremental progress.\nUltimately, You Have What It Takes To Succeed\nI empathize with the challenges your generation faces. But I also know you have the strength, creativity and wisdom needed to overcome obstacles and succeed. Take charge of your journey, and don\u2019t underestimate yourself. And along the way, remember to be kind to yourself.",
