Thank you for taking the time to encourage us. You may have written a letter to the Lancaster newspaper, but your letter has gone far beyond, as I have sent it to many of our family members and friends across the United States. It\u2019s a voice of reason and trust in our Lord God in such a time as this!\nKaren Stoltzfus\nLeacock Township",
