    "maintext": "By Mick Krever, Charbel Mallo, Ruba Alhenawi, Tamara Qiblawi and Lauren Izso, CNN\n(CNN) \u2014 For the first time since a ceasefire went into effect last week, Hezbollah has fired two projectiles toward Israeli-occupied territory, responding to repeated Israeli strikes since the agreement.\nIsrael has carried out daily strikes in Lebanon since Thursday, the day after a ceasefire went into effect. One person was killed in a strike in southern Lebanon, according to the Lebanese Ministry of Health.\nHezbollah had fired two projectiles, which landed in an open area on Monday, according to the Israeli military, which said no one was injured. The military did not specify the type of projectile fired.\nHours later, Israel\u2019s military said it began striking \u201cterror targets\u201d in Lebanon after Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vowed to retaliate in a statement, calling Hezbollah\u2019s attack \u201ca serious violation of the ceasefire.\u201d\nThe Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said earlier on Monday that its own cross-border strikes, despite the ceasefire, had been \u201cin response to several acts by Hezbollah in Lebanon that posed a threat to Israeli civilians, in violation of the understandings between Israel and Lebanon.\u201d It said it had struck military vehicles at a Hezbollah missile manufacturing site in the Beqaa Valley and tunnels near the Syrian border in northern Lebanon.\nBoth the United States and French governments have warned Israel that they believe the Israeli military has violated the terms of the ceasefire, according to CNN affiliate Kan and Israeli news outlet Ynet.\nA source with the United Nations peacekeeping force in Lebanon, UNIFIL, says Israel has breached its ceasefire agreement with Lebanon \u201capproximately 100\u201d times since the truce went into effect last week. CNN has asked the IDF for comment.\nIsraeli Foreign Minister Gideon Sa\u2019ar told his French counterpart in a phone call that his country is, in fact, enforcing the ceasefire \u2013 which stipulates Hezbollah\u2019s withdrawal from the Israel-Lebanon border area \u2013 rather than violating it, Sa\u2019ar said on X on Monday.\n\u201cThe presence of Hezbollah operatives south of (Lebanon\u2019s) Litani is a fundamental violation of the agreement and they must move north,\u201d Sa\u2019ar said, adding that Israel is \u201ccommitted to the successful implementation of the ceasefire understandings.\u201d\nHezbollah, in a statement, said that it targeted Israeli military positions \u201cin light of the repeated violations initiated by the Israeli enemy of the ceasefire agreement.\u201d Hezbollah accused Israel of breaking the ceasefire by \u201cfiring on civilians and airstrikes in different parts of Lebanon, resulting in the martyrdom of citizens and injuries to others, in addition to the continued violation of Lebanese airspace by hostile Israeli aircraft reaching the capital, Beirut.\u201d\nThe IDF said the two Hezbollah projectiles were fired toward Shebaa Farms, known in Israel as Har Dov (Mount Dov), which under international law is considered occupied Syrian territory. Israel seized Shebaa Farms, along with the Golan Heights, from Syria after it was attacked in 1967. The U.S. recognized Israel\u2019s sovereignty over the Golan Heights in 2019.\nAfter Israeli officials threatened retaliation to Hezbollah\u2019s projectiles, Lebanese state media said Israeli airstrikes hit the Al-Tuffah district in the south and the southern Nabatiyeh Governorate, which the Lebanese health ministry says killed nine people and injured at least three more. The Israeli military said the launcher that fired two projectiles into Mount Dov were among the targets it struck in Lebanon.\nA shaky start\nBoth sides have, since the early hours of last week\u2019s ceasefire, accused each other of violations, and the escalating tensions risk endangering the agreement altogether.\nA senior Israeli official said Friday that the military intends to aggressively and unilaterally act against any ceasefire violations by Hezbollah.\nUnilateral Israeli military action to enforce the ceasefire was not enshrined in the agreement between Israel and Lebanon, but the US provided Israel with a separate letter that provided assurances about Israel\u2019s right to act under certain scenarios, Israeli officials told CNN earlier.\nUS State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller said Monday that the ceasefire has not broken down. \u201cBroadly speaking,\u201d the ceasefire \u201chas been successful,\u201d he said.\n\u201cObviously, when you have any ceasefire, you can see violations of it,\u201d Miller acknowledged. He noted that the US and France had set up a mechanism \u201cto look at all of these reports of violations of the ceasefire and deal with them through the channels that the mechanisms set up, and that\u2019s what we\u2019ll do over the coming days.\u201d\nThe State Department official would not say whether the US had determined that any of the alleged violations were violations, saying that the work was ongoing. He also would not comment on reports that US envoy Amos Hochstein had raised violations in a letter to the Israeli government.\nThe ceasefire deal stipulates a 60-day cessation of hostilities, which negotiators have described as the foundation of a lasting truce. During that time, Hezbollah fighters are expected to retreat some 40 kilometers (25 miles) from the Israel-Lebanon border, while Israeli ground forces withdraw from Lebanese territory.\nUN Security Council Resolution 1701, which ended the last all-out war between the two countries in 2006, has been the basis of the deal and the negotiations have mainly revolved around the treaty\u2019s enforcement.\nUnder the agreement, Lebanon would implement a more rigorous supervision of Hezbollah\u2019s movements south of the country\u2019s Litani river, to prevent militants from regrouping there.\nUnited Nations peacekeeping troops, the Lebanese military, and a multinational committee will be tasked with supervising the Iran-backed group\u2019s movements.\nThe-CNN-Wire\n\u2122 & \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.
