    "maintext": "Pope Francis has written a moving letter to Catholics in Nicaragua to express his closeness, affection, and incessant prayer to the Virgin, imploring her consolation in the midst of the persecution of the faith that the country is suffering under the regime of President Daniel Ortega and his wife, Vice President Rosario Murillo.\nIn the context of the novena prior to the solemnity of the Immaculate Conception, the Holy Father wrote a Dec. 2 pastoral letter to the \u201cbeloved Church in Nicaragua.\u201d\nThe Pontiff professed the affection he has for the Nicaraguan people, distinguished by their \u201cextraordinary love for God,\u201d whom they affectionately call \u201cPapach\u00fa.\u201d\n\u201cI am with you,\u201d the Holy Father assured, encouraging the faithful to trust in Providence, \u201cthe only sure guide,\u201d especially in the most difficult moments, when humanly \u201cit becomes impossible to understand what God wants of us.\u201d In these circumstances, he reminded, \u201cwe are called not to doubt his care and mercy.\u201d\nPope Francis emphasized that trust in God and fidelity to the Church are \u201ctwo great beacons\u201d that illuminate their lives. \u201cBe assured that faith and hope work miracles,\u201d he said.\nHe also invited them to turn their gaze to the Immaculate Virgin, referring to the title of his letter: \u201cWho causes so much joy? The Conception of Mary!\u201d This popular expression marks the celebration of \u201cLa Griter\u00eda,\u201d a Nicaraguan tradition that fills churches every Dec. 7 in honor of the Mother of God.\nThe Pontiff expressed his hope that this celebration will be a source of encouragement \u201cin difficulties, uncertainties, and deprivations\u201d and urged the faithful to abandon themselves into the arms of Jesus with the prayer \u201cGod first.\u201d\n\u201cI want to really emphasize that the Mother of God unceasingly intercedes for you, and we continually ask Jesus to always hold you by his hand,\u201d the Holy Father added.\nHe also encouraged the faithful to pray the \u201cpowerful prayer\u201d of the rosary, where the mysteries \u201cmake their way through the intimacy of our hearts, where the freedom of the daughters and sons of God finds shelter, which no one can take away from us.\u201d\nFinally, he entrusted the people of Nicaragua to the protection of the Immaculate Conception and concluded with \u201cthat simple cry expressed with profound trust: \u2018Mary belongs to Nicaragua, Nicaragua belongs to Mary.\u2019 So be it!\u201d\nPersecution of the Church in Nicaragua\nThe Holy Father\u2019s letter comes at a critical time for Nicaragua, shortly after the National Assembly approved a constitutional reform proposed by the dictatorship by which Ortega and Murillo will henceforth be \u201cco-presidents\u201d and will officially have total control of the government.\nAmong the most controversial measures is a provision that requires that \u201creligious organizations must remain free of all foreign control.\u201d\nFor years, the Ortega regime has intensified a systematic persecution against all expressions of faith in the country. Lay faithful, priests, and bishops are constantly monitored, persecuted, abducted, and even imprisoned in deplorable conditions.\nNumerous members of the clergy have been deported from the country and stripped of their Nicaraguan citizenship, leaving them stateless, as is the case of the bishop of Matagalpa, Rolando \u00c1lvarez, who was exiled to Rome in January along with another bishop, 15 priests, and two seminarians.\nUnder the socialist regime, Catholics have been silenced and public expressions of faith, such as prayers for the persecuted or pastoral and spiritual activities, are strictly prohibited.\nFrom 2018 to 2024, 870 attacks against the Catholic Church have been recorded in Nicaragua, according to the report \u201cNicaragua: A Persecuted Church?\u201d, which documents how serious the crisis is.",
