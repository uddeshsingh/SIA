    "maintext": "The Vatican has suppressed the Carmelite Monastery of the Most Holy Trinity in Arlington, Texas, following a long-running controversy that began with a diocesan investigation into allegations that the prioress had broken her vow of chastity.\nBishop Michael Olson of the Diocese of Fort Worth, Texas, announced on Monday that he received a decree of suppression last week from the Holy See. The decree follows the dismissal of the former nuns in October by their superior after a series of disagreements with the local bishop.\nThe decree, dated Nov. 28, was signed by Cardinal Jo\u00e3o Braz de Aviz, prefect of the Dicastery for Institutes of Consecrated Life and Societies of Apostolic Life, and Consolata Missionary Sister Simona Brambilla, the secretary of the dicastery.\nThe dicastery found the community \u201cextinct\u201d and decreed the suppression of the monastery. The decree of suppression cited the \u201cnotorious defection from the Catholic faith\u201d that led to the dismissal of the five nuns as well as of the monastery\u2019s only novice, amid the expiration of the vows of the seventh member, \u201cthus, leaving the Monastery of the Most Holy Trinity with no members.\u201d\nBishop Olson announced the suppression on Dec. 2, emphasizing that the women at the monastery \u201care neither nuns nor Carmelites despite their continued and public self-identification to the contrary.\u201d\nHe added that \u201cthe Holy See has suppressed the monastery, so it exists no longer, despite any public self-identification made to the contrary by the former nuns who continue to occupy the premises.\u201d\nIn the letter, Bishop Olson reiterated an earlier announcement that Catholics should not attend Mass celebrated at the former monastery. He noted that any Masses or sacraments celebrated there \u201care illicit\u201d and that \u201cCatholics do harm to the communion of the Catholic Church by intentionally attending these ceremonies.\u201d\nThe former nuns had not published a statement in response at the time of publication. Their website continues to identify them as \u201cDiscalced Carmelite Nuns.\u201d\nThe controversy began last year when Bishop Olson launched an investigation into the monastery amid allegations that Reverend Mother Teresa Agnes Gerlach had conducted an affair with a priest.\nThe women in May 2023 filed a lawsuit against Bishop Olson over the investigation, claiming violations of privacy and harming the physical and emotional well-being of the sisters. Bishop Olson eventually dismissed Gerlach from religious life.\nIn April of this year, the Vatican declared that the Association of Christ the King in the United States of America would oversee the \u201cgovernment, discipline, studies, goods, rights, and privileges\u201d of the Texas monastery.\nThe women, however, defied the Vatican order, going so far as to associate with the Society of St. Pius X (SSPX), a traditionalist group that is not in full communion with the Catholic Church and has a canonically irregular status.\nMother Marie of the Incarnation, the president of the Association of Christ the King, who was appointed to oversee the women, announced in October that they were dismissed from the Order of Discalced Carmelites and \u201creverted to the lay state.\u201d\n\u201cI wish to repeat that since this sad series of events began to unfold in April 2023 when the former prioress self-reported to me her grave failure against the vow of chastity with a priest, I was obliged to begin the search, in accord with canon law, for both justice and mercy for all involved,\u201d Bishop OIson said in his letter.\nGerlach\u2019s admission of \u201cher grave failure against the vow of chastity with a priest,\u201d Bishop Olson noted, \u201cwas recorded and entered into the public record at a civil court hearing\u201d after the former prioress brought a civil lawsuit against Bishop Olson and the diocese.\nDuring the June 2023 court hearing, Gerlach admitted to breaking her vows of chastity and said that the affair was conducted by phone. Gerlach\u2019s lawyer, Matthew Bobo, said that Gerlach was under the influence of pain medication at the time of the hearing. Gerlach, who was hospitalized for seizures in November 2022, uses a wheelchair and feeding tube.\nIn June 2023, the diocese released photographs appearing to show cannabis products at the monastery. Bobo called the allegations of drug use \u201cabsolutely ridiculous.\u201d\nThe former nuns\u2019 most recent statement from Oct. 30 maintained that \u201cthese assertions are egregiously false.\u201d The October statement rejected the dismissal by Mother Marie, citing their recent affiliation with the Society of St. Pius X as of August.\nBishop Olson maintained that the diocese\u2019s \u201cresponse to their disobedient actions and calumny has consistently been guided by charity, patience, and has been in accord with the instructions of the Holy See.\u201d\nThe bishop asked for prayers for the former nuns, noting that the event brought \u201cgreat sadness\u201d to the local Church and himself and \u201cperpetrated a deep wound in the Body of Christ.\u201d\n\u201cI ask all of you to join me in praying for healing, reconciliation, and for the conversion of these women who have departed from the vowed religious life and notoriously defected from communion with the Catholic Church by their actions,\u201d Bishop Olson said.\n\u201cNow, as always, I wish them grace and peace in Our Lord, Jesus Christ,\u201d he added.\nIn a Nov. 29 letter to Bishop Olson, the secretary of the dicastery assured Bishop Olson of the dicastery\u2019s gratitude for his \u201cheroic and thankless service to the local Church,\u201d citing the \u201chardship and unwarranted public attention\u201d toward the local diocese. The dicastery also called on the faithful to pray for the former nuns.\nThe decree stated: \u201cThis dicastery exhorts all the members of the Discalced Carmelite Order, as well as the faithful of the Diocese of Fort Worth, to pray earnestly that the hearts of such as have erred may repent and return to the unity of the truth bestowed on the Church by Our Lord, Jesus Christ.\u201d",
