    "maintext": "The House Select Subcommittee on the Coronavirus Pandemic released its final report Monday, laying out numerous conclusions from its review of the federal pandemic response, including what the Republican-controlled panel believes to be the likely origins of the virus.\nThe 520-page document encompassed a wide range of issues relating to the pandemic including vaccinations, public health guidance, state-level actions and use of relief funds.\n\u201cSince February 2023, the Select Subcommittee sought to produce a full after-action report to provide a road map of how we, in Congress, the Executive, and the private sector may better prepare for and respond to future pandemics,\u201d subcommittee Chair Brad Wenstrup (R-Ohio) said in a letter.\n\u201cThroughout this process, the Select Subcommittee sent more than 100 investigative letters, conducted 38 transcribed interviews or depositions, held 25 hearings or meetings, and reviewed more than one million pages of documents from of custodians,\u201d he noted.\nThe subcommittee\u2019s hearings were often marked by contentious back-and-forth between members and witnesses. Several interviews were held behind closed doors, including two days of interviews with Anthony Fauci, former director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, earlier this year.\nWenstrup listed seven specific findings in his letter, including that the National Institutes of Health funded controversial gain-of-function research at the Wuhan Institute of Virology, Operation Warp Speed was \u201ctremendous success\u201d and the public school closures will have an \u201cenduring impact\u201d on American children.\nHere are three takeaways from the report:\nLab leak theory\nThe report starts with the finding that the SARS-CoV-2 virus \u201clikely emerged because of a laboratory or research related accident.\u201d\nThis finding was supported by remarks from people like Robert Redfield, the former director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), former Director of National Intelligence John Ratcliffe and former U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson, all of whom publicly stated their support for the lab leak theory.\n\u201cBased on my initial analysis of the data, I came to believe \u2014 and still believe today \u2014 that it indicates COVID-19 infections more likely were the result of an accidental lab leak than the result of a natural spillover event,\u201d Redfield is quoted as saying.\nThe report also found Fauci \u201cprompted\u201d the 2020 study titled \u201cThe proximal origin of SARS-CoV-2,\u201d which supported the natural origins theory, to \u201cdisprove\u201d the lab leak theory.\nWhen he testified before the committee in June, Fauci reiterated that he did not edit the study or help to \u201csuppress\u201d the lab leak theory.\nDifferent federal agencies have drawn different conclusions about the most likely origin of the virus, but it remains a mystery.\nMitigation efforts\nThe report is critical of many of the mitigation measures that were employed early on in the pandemic.\nIt found that masks and mask mandates were \u201cineffective at controlling the spread of COVID-19.\u201d Several studies, including one published this August, have found masking in public has an effect on lowering respiratory viral transmission, though this should not be the sole measure used to mitigate spread.\nFurther, the report concluded lockdowns caused \u201cmore harm than good\u201d to the economy, overall health of Americans and development of children.\nThe 6-foot social distancing guidance was also blasted as not being \u201csupported by science.\u201d\n\u201cEven though it was CDC guidance and not a mandate, it was forcefully implemented by state and local governments and caused lots of strife amongst Americans,\u201d the report states.\nHowever, there were some measures that the subcommittee found to have had some benefit or merit.\nThe public-private partnerships that were made to enable widespread COVID-19 testing early on in the pandemic allowed for \u201creadily available and accurate tests,\u201d though COVID-19 testing was called \u201cflawed\u201d in the report.\nTravel restrictions were also cited as having saved lives.\n\u201cWith four years of hindsight, it is clear the international travel restrictions early in the pandemic delayed spread of the virus but did not prevent COVID-19 from entering the U.S.,\u201d states the report.\nEcoHealth probes\nThe subcommittee\u2019s report paid particular attention to the actions of EcoHealth Alliance, the nongovernmental organization that sub-awarded NIH grants to global labs including the Wuhan Institute of Virology.\nEchoing criticism from members of the subcommittee, the report found EcoHealth failed to carry out proper oversight of the experiments it provided funding for, facilitated gain-of-function research and misled the NIH on the details of its research projects.\nThe NIH in turn also was found to have failed in its oversight of EcoHealth.\nThe report found that the Justice Department had empaneled a criminal grand jury to investigate the origins of COVID-19.\n\u201cEcoHealth was subject to numerous federal investigations regarding both its potential role in the COVID-19 pandemic, but also multiple accusations surrounding violated federal grant policies. The outcomes of most of these investigations are public,\u201d it states.\n\u201cHowever, the Select Subcommittee discovered that DOJ was also investigating the origins of COVID-19,\u201d it continued. \u201cThe specific details of the investigation are unknown but, based on documents, it appears the DOJ\u2019s investigation involves EcoHealth\u2019s role in the COVID-19 pandemic.\u201d\nThe report says the results of the DOJ\u2019s investigation are not public as of \u201cDecember 4, 2024,\u201d when the subcommittee plans to mark up the report.\nCopyright 2024 Nexstar Media, Inc.
