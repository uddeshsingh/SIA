    "maintext": "Clarity matters when explaining to parents how their children did on standardized tests. An imprecise characterization of a complicated score can mislead parents into assuming their kids performed better than they did.\nThat issue is at the heart of the opposition to draft revisions to descriptions of students\u2019 scores on the Smarter Balanced assessments that are sent home to parents. While the degree of difficulty of the tests and their scoring wouldn\u2019t change, the characterization of the results would, like replacing the term \u201cstandard not met\u201d with \u201cinconsistent\u201d for the lowest scores.\nThe State Board of Education delayed its adoption at its November meeting because of criticism that the revised wording may compound, not solve, current unclear language.\nBoard members listened to children\u2019s advocacy groups who chided state officials for not first consulting with teachers and parents before taking any action \u2014 which state officials acknowledged they hadn\u2019t done.\nIn a letter to the State Board about the proposed changes, particularly the labeling of low test scores, nine student advocacy groups \u2014 the Alliance for Students \u2014 argued that the revised language \u201cwill only serve to obfuscate the data and make it even more challenging for families and advocates to lift the needs of our most underserved students.\u201d Signers of the letter included Teach Plus, Children Now, and Innovate Public Schools.\nGetting the terms right is important for the assessment scores to be useful to parents and teachers, Sarah Lillis, executive director of Teach Plus, told EdSource. \u201cWe want to make sure the signals sent by the descriptors foster dialogue\u201d and encourage parents to ask the right questions.\n\u201cWe echo the concerns of our colleagues,\u201d testified Lindsay Tornatore, representing the California County Superintendents at the board\u2019s Nov. 13 meeting. \u201cOutreach to parents, families, and the community should have been prioritized to engage in multiple opportunities prior to the changes being made.\u201d\nIn response, the California Department of Education hastily scheduled online presentations this week for parents and teachers, with the expectation that they will consider any recommendations at their next meeting in January.\nHow scores are reported\nA student\u2019s scores on the Smarter Balanced tests in English Language Arts and math and on the California Science Test fall within one of four achievement levels that provide context on how the student performed. Level 4, with the highest attainable scores, is also labeled \u201cStandard Exceeded.\u201d Level 3 is labeled Standard Met; Level 2 is Standard Nearly Met, and Level 1 is Standard Not Met. Many of the dozen states and territories that give Smarter Balanced use the same definitions.\nThe target is to score at Level 3, which indicates a student is working at grade level. In the 2023-24 results, fewer than half of students achieved Levels 3 or 4: 53% scored at Levels 1 or 2 in English language arts, and 64.5% scored at Levels 1 or 2 in math. The tests are given to students in grades 3 through 8 and Grade 11.\nStatewide scores were worse in science, which is given to students in grades five, eight, and once in high school, 69.3% failed to meet Level 3 \u2014 the grade-level standard \u2014 in 2023-24.\nIn response to criticism that the existing labels are vague, imprecise and confusing, Smarter Balanced representatives decided to create a new set of labels and brief descriptions, which states have the option to use. This is particularly so for Level 2 \u2014 the standard nearly met label. Many parents don\u2019t understand what nearly meeting grade-level standards in particular means.\nUnder the Smarter Balanced draft for the scoring bands, Level 4 would become \u201cAdvanced,\u201d Level 3 would be \u201cProficient,\u201d Level 2 would be \u201cFoundational,\u201d and Level 1 would be \u201cInconsistent.\u201d\nA draft description for Level 2 in Language Arts for third to fifth grade would read, \u201cThe student demonstrates foundational grade-level skills and shows a basic understanding of and ability to apply the knowledge and skills in English language arts/literacy needed for likely success in future coursework.\u201d\nIn letters and in remarks at the board meeting, critics indicated they\u2019re fine with \u201cAdvanced\u201d and \u201cProficient\u201d but are unhappy with the labels Foundational and Inconsistent for Levels 1 and 2.\n\u201cThe language is confusing and not engaging for families with the first two levels,\u201d said Joanna French, director of research and policy strategies for Innovate Public Schools. \u201cIf a student is not at grade level, be direct about that. You cannot address a problem you cannot see.\u201d\nTonya Craft-Perry, a 15-year teacher who is active in the Black Parent Network of Innovate Public Schools, said that \u201c\u2019Foundational\u2019 could lead parents to believe their children are doing better than they are. It makes the district and teachers look better, but if a low score requires intervention, a parent needs to know that,\u201d she said.\nSeveral board members indicated that one easy remedy would be to include language in the revision\u2019s current descriptions. The wording makes clear that a student scoring in Level 2 \u201cmay require further development\u201d to demonstrate the knowledge and skills to succeed in future grades or, for older students, in college courses after high school. Students scoring in Level 1 \u201cneeds substantial improvement\u201d to succeed.\nNews media oversimplifies\nIn a two-page explanation, Smarter Balanced blamed the news media for much of the misunderstanding over the current wording of the labels.\n\u201cThe media often incorrectly reports that students who aren\u2019t proficient \u2018can\u2019t do math\u2019 or \u2018can\u2019t read.\u2019 This is not true. The Smarter Balanced assessments are aligned to grade-level content, and students who achieve Levels 2, 3, and 4 do, in fact, demonstrate a continuum of grade-level knowledge and skills,\u201d it said.\nStudents at all three of those levels are showing that they \u201cunderstand core content,\u201d said Linda Darling-Hammond, president of the California State Board, at the board meeting.\nBut as scores progress from one level to the next, students convey increasing accuracy and complexity in their knowledge and skills. Smarter Balanced said students demonstrate this in how they respond to more complex reading passages, concepts and advanced vocabulary, or in math, the number of elements in equations and difficult word problems.\nRob Manwaring, a senior adviser to the advocacy group Children Now, said that the new labels would feed the \u201creality gap in the perceptions of parents that their kids are doing better than they are\u201d in school. In an often-cited 2023 parent survey in communities nationwide, survey firm Gallup and the nonprofit parent advocacy organization Learning Heroes found that, based on their kids\u2019 report cards, parents\u2019 perceptions were out of whack with how their children did on assessments. In Sacramento County, where 28% of students were proficient in math tests, 85% of parents believed their children were proficient.\n\u201cNow we are suggesting that students scoring below standard are foundational. Many parents will conclude, \u2018My kid is doing fine,\u2019\u201d Manwaring said.",
