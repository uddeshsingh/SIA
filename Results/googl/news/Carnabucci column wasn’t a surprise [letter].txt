Summary: Let me start by saying I’m not surprised that the LNP | LancasterOnline Opinion editors found someone to write what I viewed as a hit piece about Donald Trump (“Dispatches from the demonstration against Trump in Lancaster city’s Penn Square,” column by Karen Carnabucci in the Oct. 27 Sunday LNP | LancasterOnline Perspective section). And I wasn’t surprised that the columnist was a former journalist, or that many of her complaints could also be said of President Joe Biden. My complaint isn’t so much about Carnabucci as it is about LNP | LancasterOnline. In my view, this newspaper stopped being impartial a long time ago, but still wants to be considered a legitimate journalistic endeavor. Most of this probably doesn’t matter, since it appears that LNP | LancasterOnilne is about to become extinct or, at best, a small shell of itself.
