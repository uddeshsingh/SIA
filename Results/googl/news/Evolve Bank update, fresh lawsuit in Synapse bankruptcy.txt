But for this to work properly, "the bank has to have accurate records of who the beneficial owners are," said Todd Baker, a senior fellow at the Richman Center for Business, Law & Public Policy at Columbia University and the managing principal of Broadmoor Consulting. Sherrod Brown of Ohio, Ron Wyden of Oregon, Tammy Baldwin of Wisconsin and John Fetterman of Pennsylvania urged Synapse, its investors and its bank and fintech partners to restore customers' access to their money.
