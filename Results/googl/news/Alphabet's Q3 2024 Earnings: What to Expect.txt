Summary: With a market cap of $2 trillion, Alphabet Inc. (GOOG) is a global technology company and the parent of Google. The company has consistently surpassed Wall Street’s EPS projections in the past four quarters. GOOG stock is up 17.4% on a YTD basis, underperforming the S&P 500 Index’s ($SPX) 21.9% gains and the Communication Services Select Sector SPDR ETF Fund’s (XLC) 24.8% returns over the same time frame. While the company beat expectations with earnings of $1.89 per share and revenue of $84.7 billion, concerns arose after management warned that Q3 margins could be pressured due to increased expenses in AI and tech infrastructure. In addition, the stock fell 2.4% on Aug. 14 after reports that the U.S. Department of Justice was considering a full-scale breakup of the company following a ruling that its payments to be the default search engine on devices like Apple's and Samsung's constituted an illegal monopoly.
