Summary: A New York high school ice hockey player died Saturday night after losing consciousness midway through a game. Nassau County Police said in a news release that officers responded to an incident on Nov. 30 at 9 p.m. at the Town of Oyster Bay Ice Skating Center in Bethpage, New York. "Connor experienced a sudden medical event during a varsity ice hockey game last night and was transported to the hospital by ambulance," the letter from Massapequa High School Principal Barbara Lowell read in part. He had a way of bringing light and joy to those around him, and his absence will be felt deeply by all of us," Brennan wrote in a message shared with Massapequa students and families. The coaches of the Massapequa varsity ice hockey team said in a joint statement that Connor's unexpected death had left their community "completely heartbroken."
