Summary: Under the law, companies that produce packaging materials must pay into a fund managed by a third-party stewardship organization contracted by the Department of Environmental Protection. Mills signed the law in 2021, but the state Board of Environmental Protection is currently determining the exact rules for its implementation. However, the leadership at a half-dozen groups, including the Maine State Chamber of Commerce, said the board’s latest set of proposed rules could create uncertainty and undue hardship for businesses in a letter sent to Mills’ office Monday. The associations argue that this creates a punitive structure which could rapidly increase the cost of doing business in Maine. Chamber of Commerce CEO Patrick Woodcock said the new rules are creating uncertainty for business owners planning their 2026 budgets.
