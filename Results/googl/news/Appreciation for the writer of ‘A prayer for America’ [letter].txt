Summary: This letter is sent in appreciation for the writer of the Oct. 30 LNP | LancasterOnline letter “A prayer for America.” It was a very thoughtful and well-written prayer for America! Thank you for taking the time to encourage us. You may have written a letter to the Lancaster newspaper, but your letter has gone far beyond, as I have sent it to many of our family members and friends across the United States. It’s a voice of reason and trust in our Lord God in such a time as this! Karen Stoltzfus Leacock Township
