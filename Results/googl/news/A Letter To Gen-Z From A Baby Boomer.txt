Summary: I believe in the resilience and capability of my children, my Gen-Z clients and all Gen-Zers to leverage great opportunities and navigate the challenges in front of them. Could we brainstorm a solution that works for both of us?” Prioritize Connecting With People Face-To-Face We live in a digital age, and technology enables us to stay in touch with each other. Finding and respectfully using your authentic voice during this critical stage of your life will give you inner peace and confidence because you’ll be able to express yourself truthfully. Recognize Your Power When we’re young, it can be easy to fall into the trap of blaming people and external circumstances for the situations we find ourselves in. When things don’t go as you planned or hoped, you’ll be able to take action rather than fall into a loop of self-doubt, imposter syndrome and/or inaction.
