Summary: Alphabet's prior report offered some puts and takes, but the company was an "all-around winner" in the latest quarter, with all segments coming in ahead of revenue expectations. Alphabet posted a big positive surprise on Google Cloud revenue, but its margin expansion of 17% for the segment garnered some attention on the earnings call. This came in response to a question from Evercore analyst Mark Mahaney, who asked about Alphabet's confidence in its ability to get cloud margins near those of larger peers, in the realm of 30%. "Realizing those opportunities and great innovation in AI requires global reach, which we have through our products at platforms, as well as continued meaningful capital investment," Ashkenazi said. Google is seeing traction with short-form video as well, with new options for advertisers as well as new functionality that lets people upload "Shorts" that are up to three minutes long.
