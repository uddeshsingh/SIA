Summary: Liggan got a letter in the mail saying the City of Dayton is looking to put a paper recycling facility near her house, now she’s worried. “We are concerned about the air quality and potential exposure to pollutants,” the Trotwood Madison Superintendent said in a statement. The City of Trotwood adds to the complaints, citing a possible decrease in property value in their letter to Dayton. “If that plant is going to affect my security and our safety and everything that I have accomplished, that means I’ll have to move,” Liggan said. A meeting is scheduled for Thursday at 6 p.m. at the Dayton Library’s West Branch.
