Summary: In the letter, a copy of which was reviewed by CRN, Bay wrote that Ingram Micro is undertaking a “series of restructuring activities” across the company over the next three months that will result in the elimination of 850 employees. [Related: The 10 Biggest Tech Company Layoffs Of 2024 (So Far)] The restructuring includes the integration of Ingram Micro’s digital and information technology teams to reduce costs and eliminate redundancies, transforming the company’s historical shared services model into an exception-based model, and streamlining selected country, business, and functional organizations. Mark Essayian, president of Irvine, Calif.-based KME Systems, an Ingram Micro partner, said while the layoffs are unfortunate, he’s not surprised given that the company recently went public. The human element is real, almost [900] people are going to lose their job.” However, Essayian said he believes Bay has proven he knows how to run a successful company and is making “these tough choices” to ensure the business remains competitive. Another Ingram Micro partner, James Rocker, CEO of Hauppauge, N.Y.-based MSP Nerds That Care, said he’s cautiously optimistic that the layoffs would not significantly disrupt key relationships.
