Summary: Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan on Wednesday night said the north is “ready” to transition to the new common Turkic alphabet. “It is a relief to know that we are ready for this, and education scientists and linguists will surely now receive the reward for all the academic studies they have been carrying out for days and months,” he began.
