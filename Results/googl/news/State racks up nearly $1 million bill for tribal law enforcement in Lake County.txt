Summary: That agreement has seen Lake County officers and attorneys, rather than federal officials, handle felony crimes committed by tribal members. While the arrangement is popular, mostly because local crime doesn’t fall through the cracks, Lake County’s elected officials say they can no longer cover the cost. During that time, the county spoke with federal officials about the prospect of them taking over policing and the prosection of tribal members, as is done elsewhere in the state. A year ago, the Lake County Commission voted to pull out of Public Law 280 and sent a letter to Gianforte requesting that he sign a proclamation releasing it from the agreement. Sen. Greg Hertz of Polson told MTFP that he intends to push for legislation during the 2025 session to help Lake County cover the cost of law enforcement.
Financial_Events: ['In years past, county officials said the bill was easier to pay thanks to taxes generated by the Séliš Ksanka QÍispé Dam, but once the dam was sold to the Confederated Salish and Kootenai Tribes, that revenue dried up.\nOver the years, the Legislature has made multiple attempts to get the state to help foot the bill']
