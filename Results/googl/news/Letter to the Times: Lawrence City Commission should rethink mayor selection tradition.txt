Description: ”Allowing the commission to choose who they think would be the best fit (for mayor) would allow us to have more than one year with a commissioner who does a great job,” Chris Flowers writes in this letter to the Times.

Title: Letter to the Times: Lawrence City Commission should rethink mayor selection tradition

Summary: For starters, one of the reasons for a different mayor each year has been that it keeps our advisory boards from being stacked with people chosen by one person. Singling out a commissioner to not get a turn based on election results makes more sense when it’s a two-year term. One of the arguments I’ve heard for our current tradition is that if there is a mayor who is terrible, we only have to have them for one year. Well, at this point I think the main thing they do is run city commission meetings. This leads to inconsistency with how meetings are run and rules enforced over a course of four years.
