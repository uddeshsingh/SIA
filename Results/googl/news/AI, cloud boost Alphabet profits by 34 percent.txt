Summary: Alphabet’s profit jumped 34 percent in the third quarter as the parent company of search giant Google reported strong growth in its cloud business amid robust demand for computing and data services used to train and run generative artificial intelligence models. The solid results released on Tuesday helped alleviate investors’ fears about the financial returns on the vast sums being spent on AI by Alphabet and other Big Tech peers as they seek to dominate the nascent sector. “We continue to invest in state-of-the-art infrastructure to support our AI efforts, from the US to Thailand, to Uruguay.” However, Google’s cloud business remains a distant third to Microsoft’s Azure and market leader Amazon Web Services, and competition is cut-throat. Google is the first of Silicon Valley’s tech giants to report earnings this quarter, and investors will be watching to see how much more money they have poured into data centers and advanced chips that power AI—and whether any of those bets are starting to pay off. More immediately, Google faces the prospect of being broken up after losing a landmark antitrust case brought by the US Department of Justice, which resulted in a ruling that determined its search business had engaged in anti-competitive monopolistic behavior.
