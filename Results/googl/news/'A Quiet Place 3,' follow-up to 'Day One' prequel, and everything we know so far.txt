Summary: Continuing the story of a world overrun by terrifying alien creatures that hunt by sound, the next main entry could potentially pick up with Emily Blunt in the lead, but whether John Krasinski will return as director remains uncertain. Oscar winner Lupita Nyong’o plays a terminally ill poet named Sam on a day trip to New York City when the monsters arrive. The latest trailer shows the two planning an escape route only to see government jets bomb the bridges leading out of Manhattan, presumably to keep the monsters overrunning the city from reaching the mainland. Djimon Hounsou, who appeared in "A Quiet Place Part II" as the unnamed leader of a small island colony of survivors, reprises his role in "Day One." Blunt told Collider that Krasinski has plenty of ideas for both a sequel to the Abbott family and for a tangential film, explaining that he “wanted to see how people responded to this one ("A Quiet Place 2") before he fully engaged his brain on the third one.
