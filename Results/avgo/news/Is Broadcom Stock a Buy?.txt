Description: While Nvidia has been the biggest semiconductor stock winner from the artificial intelligence (AI) infrastructure buildout, Broadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO) could be poised to be the next big winner in the space. Let's dig into Broadcom's AI opportunity and whether now is a good time to buy the stock. Broadcom participates in the AI infrastructure buildout in two primary ways.

Summary: The company contends that as AI clusters grow in size, there will be distributed computing challenges, and networking will become an increasingly more important piece of the infrastructure buildout. Thus far, different cloud computing companies have preferred employing different technologies, with Microsoft opting for InfiniBand while Amazon has leaned more into Ethernet. Nonetheless, the market appears to be large enough for multiple winners, with Broadcom seeing its Ethernet switching revenue quadruple in the third quarter. Alphabet was Broadcom's first big ASIC customer, as it helped the company create its tensor-processing unit for AI workloads. Given that many of its cyclical businesses appear to be near their bottoms and the AI opportunity in front it, Broadcom looks like a solid option for investors to consider buying at current levels.
Financial_Events: ["Currently, there are competing switching technologies in the space trying to solve this issue.\nWhile Intel has a switching technology called Omni-Path, the two most prevalent switching technologies are Nvidia's InfiniBand, which it acquired with its acquisition of Mellanox, and Ethernet", 'Nonetheless, the market appears to be large enough for multiple winners, with Broadcom seeing its Ethernet switching revenue quadruple in the third quarter.\nThe bigger opportunity for Broadcom, however, is helping customers develop custom chips (application-specific integrated circuits, or ASICs) for their AI workloads', "For its part, the company argues that custom ASICs are superior to Nvidia's mass merchant graphics processing units (GPUs) in a hyperscale cloud environment, although that certainly does not show up in the two companies' revenue numbers.\nThat said, there is certainly a place for custom AI silicon, and a number of companies are working with Broadcom to develop custom chips designed for specific computing and power needs.\nAlphabet was Broadcom's first big ASIC customer, as it helped the company create its tensor-processing unit for AI workloads", 'Meanwhile, major news outlets have reported that OpenAI has been working with Broadcom on its own custom chips, although neither company has confirmed this.\nBroadcom continually raised its expectations for AI revenue throughout the year', 'It originally forecast approximately $7.5 billion in AI revenue for 2024, while that guidance has risen steadily to currently be at $12 billion', 'With its new customers, I would expect that revenue to continue to grow nicely in 2025', "However, with so few customers, custom ASIC revenue growth can be lumpier than the type of growth Nvidia generates.\nImage source: Getty Images.\nIs it time to buy Broadcom stock?\nWhile Broadcom's AI-related businesses have been performing strongly, its non-AI semiconductor businesses have struggled", 'Last quarter, its server storage connectivity revenue dropped 25% year over year while its broadband revenue sank 49%', 'Meanwhile, its wireless revenue only edged up 1%.\nHowever, there are certainly signs that these more cyclical businesses have found a bottom in recent quarters', 'Server storage connectivity revenue grew sequentially, while it expects broadband revenue to recover early in 2025', 'Meanwhile, it is looking for wireless revenue to jump 20% sequentially in the fourth quarter.\nA recovery in its non-AI semiconductor businesses, plus its AI growth, should bode well for 2025', "This strategy has been seeing solid momentum, with annualized bookings up 32% last quarter compared to the preceding quarter.\nFrom a valuation perspective, Broadcom now trades at a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of around 22.6 times next year's analyst estimates.\nAVGO PE Ratio (Forward 1y) data by YCharts.\nGiven that many of its cyclical businesses appear to be near their bottoms and the AI opportunity in front it, Broadcom looks like a solid option for investors to consider buying at current levels"]
