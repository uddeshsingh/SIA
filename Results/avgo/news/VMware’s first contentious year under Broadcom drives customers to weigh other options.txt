Summary: In the blink of an eye, customers accustomed to selecting solutions from an a la carte menu of nearly 170 software packages and thousands of stock-keeping-unit pricing options were faced with a virtual fork in the road — VCF or vSphere. The firm expects half of the customer base to initiate proofs of concept for VMware replacements in the next two years and nearly one-third to switch to alternative hypervisor and container platform solutions by 2028. Virtualization realities As the changes sunk in, customers cycled through five stages of budgeting grief, slipping from anger and denial into the bargaining phase before moving on to depression and ultimately an uneasy kind of acceptance. AT&T EVP and GM of Wireline Transformation and Global Supply Chain Susan Johnson said in an August email addressed to Broadcom CEO Hock Tan that the impasse stemmed from a looming 1,050% increase in its VMware bill. “You knew the price was going up, that things were going to change and that Broadcom was not easy to negotiate with.” Size matters While each VMware customer is contending with unique infrastructure needs and vendor issues, the AT&T situation illustrates the complicated nature of IT dependencies.
Financial_Events: ['Customers were right to worry.\nThe semiconductor giant’s $61 billion acquisition of the ubiquitous virtualization technology provider on Nov', 'The acquisition of VMware, however, and the ensuing licensing changes has threatened to upend core infrastructure, disrupt critical business processes and wreak havoc on spending.\nVMware costs and corresponding increases vary across the customer base, Scott Bickley, practice lead and principal research director at Info-Tech Research Group, told CIO Dive', 'Customers who’d neglected to renew licenses ahead of the acquisition — which Gartner said represented roughly 50% of VMware’s midmarket base — bristled at implications of the Broadcom bundles.\nForrester fielded so many VMware inquiries that it created a Teams channel devoted solely to the topic, Tracy Woo, principal analyst at the firm, said.\nWoo characterized Broadcom’s strategy as an effort to divorce the customer', 'The telecommunications giant sought to extend support services based on prior, pre-acquisition contractual terms.\nBroadcom fired back in court, noting VMware provided customers with advance notice of a long-planned business model transition, claiming AT&T had indicated its intention to find another provider', '“You knew the price was going up, that things were going to change and that Broadcom was not easy to negotiate with.”\nSize matters\nWhile each VMware customer is contending with unique infrastructure needs and vendor issues, the AT&T situation illustrates the complicated nature of IT dependencies.\nVMware, which commanded 97% of the virtualization software market revenue prior to the merger, remains too deeply embedded in IT ecosystems to simply abandon, according to Gartner.\nThe technology continues to earn positive ratings from the firm, despite customer unease over the acquisition — and the price tag.\n“When CIOs look at these renewals, they see $40,000 turn into $400,000, $1 million turn into $10 million, and they can no longer justify the cost based on the service it provides to the organization,” Cisek said', "“We are seeing renewals that are flat or even slightly less expensive than the previous term's pricing due to the bundled discounting in VCF.”\nBroadcom cut the cost of VCF in half with the subscription bundle, reducing the price to $350 per core annually, VCF Division VP of Product Marketing Prashanth Shenoy told CIO Dive.\n“It was the business model shift from perpetual to subscription that caused all the angst in the market,” Shenoy said.\nThe company began moving toward a SaaS billing model prior to the acquisition but the pace quickened this year under the banner of product simplification", "“We want to truly focus our R&D innovations on the best possible platforms and services that our customers want,” he added.\nThe full-stack solution wasn't universally embraced.\n“The disconnect comes for people who only use three products and now have to pay five or ten times as much for the bundle,” said Bickley.\nUnemotional rescue\nThe Broadcom acquisition unleashed an initial wave of organizational anxiety followed by sticker shock"]
