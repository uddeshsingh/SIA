Summary: Focusing in on number three on the list, Broadcom Inc (NASDAQ:AVGO) is the only chip manufacturer in the top 20. Per Schaeffer's Senior Quantitative Analyst Rocky White, AVGO finished the month of December higher eight times in the past 10 years, averaging a gain of 7.3%. In fact, subscribers to Expiration Week Countdown tripled their money with our AVGO put recommendation last month. Broadcom stock's 14-day relative strength index (RSI) of 21.9 sits in "oversold" territory, which is also indicative of a short-term bounce. Plus, long-term support at the 200-day moving average -- which captured pullbacks in August and September -- still lingers below.
