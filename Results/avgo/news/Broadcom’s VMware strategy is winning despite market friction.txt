Summary: Our bottom line is despite near term license cost increases, we found the long-term economic analysis to be compelling in the sense that it will capture the attention of senior executives. Many customers have told us they like AVS as an option because its a managed private cloud offering from Microsoft that essentially bundles VCF including key elements such as vSAN. After years of hand-wringing, navel-gazing and market confusion, legacy VMware affected a strategy that relied on partnerships with cloud players, sharing the wealth. Take into consideration that Broadcom’s commentary on its earnings calls and anecdotally in the field speaking with customers suggests that VMware is a long-term play that will pay significant dividends in the future. On balance, however, we believe Broadcom is executing ahead of expectations on its VMware progress and is establishing the basis for a long-term platform asset that will be an industry force for the next decade and perhaps beyond.
Financial_Events: ['Broadcom Inc.’s acquisition of VMware Inc', 'But customer conversations and recent data suggest that while migrations are happening, the real story is that VMware’s more narrow focus and cost discipline are allowing Broadcom to integrate VMWare into its highly successful business model.\nSpecifically, we see two seemingly countervailing trends that are both possible to be true: 1) Customers are actively moving many low value workloads off VMware; and 2) Most mission-critical work is staying put, allowing Broadcom to dramatically increase the contribution from its software business and deliver a roadmap for customers that will often be more cost-effective than migrating.\nIn this Breaking Analysis, we share results from the latest Enterprise Technology Research spending data and provide our latest thinking on the often discussed and frequently maligned VMware acquisition; and why it’s a win for customers, competitors and Broadcom specifically.\nMedia backlash fueled by licensing changes\nIt’s easy to find negative sentiment in the press, social media and reddit threads about the changes Broadcom has imposed with respect to ending perpetual licenses and limiting the bespoke options across the VMware portfolio.\nMany headlines underscore the negative sentiment toward Broadcom’s moves', 'But the company has been unapologetic and, quite the opposite, optimistic with customers, strongly marketing the economic benefits of going all-in on the VMware Cloud Foundation bundle.\nOne notable comment in a Reddit thread highlighted above in red is that by some measures, costs are actually lower than pre-acquisition', 'We know from customer conversations that the VCF bundle is not the predominant procurement model today and fewer than 20% of customers pre-acquisition were all-in on VCF', 'As such, to the extent Broadcom can convince customers to stay, the company has significant upside to its VMware business.\nThis strategy was highlighted on the last earnings call by Broadcom Chief Executive Hock Tan, who stated:\nCustomers are both migrating and staying\nMany narratives from the media and competitors suggest that customers are angry, they’re migrating and calls for help are numerous', 'Their promise is, despite the new packaging, crackdown on perpetual licenses and more revenue they’re extracting, the company will:\nStreamline the portfolio.\nMake simpler to do business.\nInvest R&D on those features that are most important to the business.\nCreate an offering that is more cost effective than alternatives when considering the full picture.\nMigrations are nontrivial\nTaking into account change management, business process disruption, application portfolio impacts, skills required, error rates and the effort to abstract away the complexity of migration pain, in many cases the juice as they say isn’t going to be worth the squeeze.\nThe win-win-win for customers, competitors and Broadcom\nIt seems counterintuitive that Broadcom, by completely altering VMware’s packaging, pricing and partnership strategy, would be a win for anyone other than Broadcom', 'The downside is the checks your write to Broadcom will be larger but at the same time you won’t have the latest VMware acquisition du jour jammed down your throat; and you ideally won’t have to deal with a collection of less than ideally integrated and offerings', 'As such, the business Broadcom is pushing away is likely at least as profitable for these firms as their existing business', 'It can drive new top line revenue and open up new vectors of growth in a market that previously was untouchable with VMware’s historical model.\nFor Broadcom and its investors', 'But VMware is on track to hit $4 billion in quarterly revenue and $8.5 billion in adjusted EBITDA', 'Originally Broadcom promised the latter result within three years of the acquisition but is on track to achieve or exceed that goal in FY 2025.\nBack-of-napkin math: Broadcom’s valuation is roughly 25 to 30 times adjusted EBITDA', 'Of course, valuations can fluctuate but that’s at least a threefold return in valuation terms to shareholders in a couple of years.\nTake into consideration that Broadcom’s commentary on its earnings calls and anecdotally in the field speaking with customers suggests that VMware is a long-term play that will pay significant dividends in the future.\nThe bottom line\nOur belief is that much of the trade press negative narrative is misplaced']
