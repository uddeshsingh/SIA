Summary: In the past year, Fisher’s firm made a 32.18% return, mainly because it invested a lot in tech stocks, especially those benefiting from the AI boom. While other managers are selling tech stocks due to high valuations, Fisher’s firm is buying more, especially in companies making AI chips. Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) sells various semiconductor products, including those for the computer networking, storage, and broadband sectors related to artificial intelligence. Likewise, Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) has succeeded in securing stable revenue streams from Alphabet and Meta Platforms for virtualization software. While we acknowledge the potential of AVGO as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe.
