Summary: “From a single stock perspective, we think many of the large U.S. tech companies offer appealing long-term upside, especially those that have leading positions in the AI value chain,” shared UBS. The list starts from Neutral and ends at Most Attractive, and the sectors themselves were ranked by the total number of hedge fund investors in the component stocks. Starting from the former, Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) depends on its ability to sustain and grow recurring revenue and sales along with cost control to drive margins. Here’s what management shared during the Q1 2025 earnings call: “Data Cloud gives every company a single source of truth and you can securely power AI insights and actions across the entire Customer 360.
