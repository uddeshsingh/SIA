Summary: "I’m thrilled to share today that I’ve joined Meta to lead a new Business AI group," said Shih. Mark Zuckerberg's company doesn't sell a subscription to its AI chatbots, like OpenAI or Google, in order to generate revenue. Specifically, Meta's new group will offer AI products made with Llama to the millions of businesses advertising and creating content on Instagram, Facebook, and WhatsApp. It's unclear if Meta will sell these AI tools, or if they'll be offered for free as a way to drive up ad spending — the company's main source of revenue. "This new product group under Clara’s leadership will help us bring that vision to life.” Shih previously led Salesforce's AI efforts, which have not exactly been a huge success.
