Summary: The technology giant is hoping recently added artificial intelligence features are enough to entice consumers to treat themselves or their loved ones to a new iPhone for the holidays. Walt Disney Co. has the biggest percentage gain for the month at 22.1%, but the price-weighted index also got a boost from Goldman Sachs, up 17.5% to $608.57, and Salesforce, up more than 13% to $329.99. Investors believe the credit card company’s merger with Capital One has a greater chance of going through under a Trump administration and overall the financial services industry faces less restrictive oversight. Musk also gave a boost to Hasbro shares after he triggered takeover speculation when he asked in a post on X how much the toy and game company was worth. Retailers’ stocks drove market gains after a two-day meeting in Beijing that focused on promoting consumption ended on Thursday.
