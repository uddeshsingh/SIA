Summary: Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements. As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued. Trillions of dollars are already pouring into clean energy initiatives, from solar power to hydrogen fuel cells.

Financial_Events: ["Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?\nWhile media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.\nRevisions to Earnings Estimates\nHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else", "That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.\nOur analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account", 'When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well', 'Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.\nFor the current quarter, Salesforce.com is expected to post earnings of $2.43 per share, indicating a change of +15.2% from the year-ago quarter', 'The Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged over the last 30 days.\nThe consensus earnings estimate of $10.08 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +22.6%', 'This estimate has remained unchanged over the last 30 days.\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $11.13 indicates a change of +10.4% from what Salesforce.com is expected to report a year ago', "Over the past month, the estimate has remained unchanged.\nHaving a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions", "Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Salesforce.com is rated Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n12 Month EPS\nProjected Revenue Growth\nWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues", "After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues", "So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.\nFor Salesforce.com, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $9.34 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +7.1%", 'For the current and next fiscal years, $37.86 billion and $41.23 billion estimates indicate +8.6% and +8.9% changes, respectively.\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\nSalesforce.com reported revenues of $9.33 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +8.4%', 'EPS of $2.56 for the same period compares with $2.12 a year ago.\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $9.23 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +1.04%', "The company topped consensus revenue estimates three times over this period.\nValuation\nWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient", "In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.\nWhile comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.\nAs part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\nSalesforce.com is graded D on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers", 'It’s a multi-trillion dollar industry that has created some of the world’s largest and most profitable companies.\nNow state-of-the-art technology is paving the way for clean energy sources to overtake “old-fashioned” fossil fuels']
