Summary: As 2024 heads to a close, investors are now focused on the state of the economy, its influence on the Federal Reserve’s interest rate reduction cycle, and the potential offered by the technology industry. Broadly speaking, these factors are growing energy requirements and capital expenditure costs, global geopolitical tensions, model inaccuracies, and regulatory constraints.

Consequently, future performance depends on the ability of Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) to blend AI into its business model and benefit from its sizable market share. While we acknowledge the potential of CRM as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame.
