Summary: THE lure of US$10 gift cards wasn’t enough to draw big early-bird Black Friday crowds at the Macy’s Inc flagship New York City location in Herald Square. Macy’s and other retailers that cater to middle-income consumers went into the holiday shopping season hoping that exclusive products and special promotions could help revive demand in an otherwise humdrum year. Their efforts spoke to the high stakes that many retailers are facing after a year of sluggish sales with consumers fatigued by the higher prices that dogged the post-pandemic period. Soft expectations US retailers garner about 20% of their annual sales during the holiday season, and early projections have pointed to this year being softer than those past. Target, which cut its annual forecast last week citing slowing demand for discretionary products, saw an early rush of shoppers who came to buy Taylor Swift’s The Eras Tour Book, which the company said is already its bestselling title of the year.
