Summary: The Greek media company Antenna Group is in talks to acquire Time from Salesforce co-founder Marc Benioff, according to people familiar with the matter. The talks come at a particularly turbulent time for legacy media companies, which are trying to stay afloat as digital-first assets amid competition with free services such as YouTube, TikTok and Instagram. The Washington Post, owned by fellow tech billionaire Jeff Bezos, has lost more than 10% of its subscribers in recent days after deciding it wouldnâ€™t endorse a candidate in the U.S. presidential election, according to NPR. Benioff and his wife, Lynne, bought Time from Meredith Corp., which owned the magazine for less than a year. Disclosure: Comcast owns NBCUniversal, the parent company of CNBC, NBC News and MSNBC.
