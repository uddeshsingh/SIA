Summary: At its annual re:Invent conference in Las Vegas, the company has now announced a number of updates to Connect which, unsurprisingly, focus on AI, powered by the Amazon Q platform. “When we first came out, we were really a voice-only solution that focused heavily on bringing AI to the contact center [with] scalability, security — the things that are our calling cards for AWS. “Now, we offer channels across everything from chat, email — coming out as we speak — and also SMS, WhatsApp, Apple Messaging for Business.” DeMaio stressed that AWS built Connect as an end-to-end solution that is now in use by over 14,000 external customers, as well as Amazon.com itself. “Companies can now use a single routing and workflow solution for their Amazon Connect and Salesforce channels to intelligently deliver calls, chats, email, and cases to the right self-service or agent interaction,” AWS explains. “When I talk to customers in the real world who are trying to do this, their big thing is: please stop trying to ram [generative] AI down my throat for every solution,” DeMaio said.
