Summary: Retail media networks provide not only cost advantages but also a level of measurability that is increasingly critical as marketers face tighter budgets and higher expectations for accountability. However, if Chrome’s sale disrupts how programmatic ads are served, it could force brands to rethink their reliance on Google’s display and YouTube networks. Alternative platforms like retail media networks and direct buys may become more appealing as advertisers seek greater control and transparency in their programmatic strategies. Key considerations include: Diversification: Advertisers must evaluate where they’re allocating budgets and identify opportunities to reduce reliance on any single platform. ROI focus: Platforms with proven measurement capabilities, like retail media networks, will gain importance as marketers prioritize accountability.
