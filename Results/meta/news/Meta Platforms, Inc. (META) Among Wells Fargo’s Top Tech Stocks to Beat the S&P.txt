Summary: As 2024 heads to a close, investors are now focused on the state of the economy, its influence on the Federal Reserve’s interest rate reduction cycle, and the potential offered by the technology industry. Broadly speaking, these factors are growing energy requirements and capital expenditure costs, global geopolitical tensions, model inaccuracies, and regulatory constraints.
