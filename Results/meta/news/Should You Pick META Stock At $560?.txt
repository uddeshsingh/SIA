Summary: Not only did the company post higher revenues, its operating margin expanded to 43%, up around 300 bps y-o-y. A rise in valuation multiple for META makes sense given the solid advertising growth lately. However, continued aggressive investments into AI also poses a slight risk if it would eventually provide a meaningful boost to the company’s earnings growth. Although META stock has seen a 2x rise since 2021, the increase has been far from consistent, with annual returns being considerably more volatile than the S&P 500. In contrast, the Trefis High Quality Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, is considerably less volatile.
