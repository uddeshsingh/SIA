Summary: TikTok Inc. and parent company ByteDance Ltd. filed notice Friday saying they will appeal a pair of court rulings advancing hundreds of lawsuits from parents and school districts alleging the social media app causes addiction among children. The notice asks the San Francisco-based US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit to review the trial court orders which denied TikTokâs motion to dismiss based on Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, a decades-old federal law that immunizes online platforms from lawsuits based on user-created content.
