Summary: Its entire family of apps (Facebook, Messenger, Instagram, and WhatsApp) served 3.29 billion daily active people (DAP) in the third quarter. A lot of Meta's recent growth was driven by Chinese e-commerce and gaming companies, which bought more ads on Facebook and Instagram to reach overseas customers. Meta also plowed $30.1 billion into its buybacks in the first nine months of 2024, but that strategy makes a lot more sense relative to its stable profits and healthy cash flows. Analysts expect Meta's earnings per share to grow 52% in 2024 and 11% in 2025, even as it ramps up its cloud infrastructure, artificial intelligence (AI), and Reality Labs investments over the next few quarters. Snap can't be valued by its non-existent earnings yet, but it looks historically cheap relative to its top-line growth at just 3 times next year's sales.
