Summary: With Elon Musk already demonstrating how tech leaders can prioritize accountability and transparency, the incoming administration would be positioned to transform how social media companies respond to child exploitation. The platform reported 400,000 CSAM incidents in a single quarter of 2023 through the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children's CyberTipline, yet their response times to law enforcement requests remain inadequate. Required immediate actions for the incoming administration include establishing mandatory 24/7 emergency response teams, implementing immediate evidence preservation protocols with severe penalties for delays, and empowering federal agencies to impose immediate sanctions for non-compliance. His incoming administration must be prepared to use every available tool to ensure immediate compliance with law enforcement requests and mandatory implementation of protection technologies The time for half-measures and corporate virtue signaling is over. The issue of child exploitation rises above party lines, and the incoming administration could make a concerted effort to build a broad coalition of lawmakers and stakeholders who share the common goal of protecting vulnerable children.
