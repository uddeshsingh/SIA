Summary: Australia's Senate passed legislation Wednesday that, once signed by the country's leader who has strongly endorsed it, will ban children under the age of 16 from using most social media platforms. In a statement posted online Tuesday, Meta said it was "concerned the government is rushing this legislation without adequate consultation or evidence and there are still many unknowns with respect to its implementation." "The Government's approach will likely require each app provider to collect personal identification or biometric data from all Australians in order to prevent under 16s from accessing their services, an inefficient and burdensome process for everyone," a Meta spokesperson said. "We are asking the government to reconsider this legislative approach and instead use the momentum of this moment to hold the social media giants to account, to demand that they embed safety into their platforms rather than adding it as an afterthought, and to work closely with experts and children and young people themselves to make online spaces safer, as opposed to off-limits," Tinkler said. "There are less restrictive alternatives available that could achieve the aim of protecting children and young people from online harms, but without having such a significant negative impact on other human rights.
