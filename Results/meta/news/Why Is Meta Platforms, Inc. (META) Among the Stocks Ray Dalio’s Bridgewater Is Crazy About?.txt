Summary: Ray Dalio, a seasoned global macro investor with over 50 years of experience, founded Bridgewater Associates from his two-bedroom apartment in New York City and led the firm for most of its 47-year history. Millions of Chinese citizens enter the middle class each year, and if the government can successfully restructure debt in critical sectors like housing, China’s long-term growth prospects remain significant. The “All-Weather” ETF Bridgewater Associates recently partnered with State Street’s asset management division to expand into the retail investment market, marking a strategic shift for the hedge fund. This move reflects a growing trend among hedge funds venturing into the $14 trillion ETF market, which has flourished due to its liquidity, tax efficiency, and typically lower fees. The company’s strategic investments in AI to improve app user experiences and engagement have bolstered its ability to attract high-value advertising campaigns, ensuring continued growth in its core business segments.
