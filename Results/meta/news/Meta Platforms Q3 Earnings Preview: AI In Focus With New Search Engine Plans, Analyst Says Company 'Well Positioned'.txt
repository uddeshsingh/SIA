Summary: "We think the report makes sense as reducing dependence on large tech peers likely a strategic priority for Meta," Post said. The analyst said Meta's conference call will likely feature commentary on artificial intelligence and search capabilities. Post said Meta creating its own search engine would be consistent with the company's long-term goal of reducing "dependence on competitor platforms." "If users increasingly engage with Meta AI for information, there is a possibility that a portion of internet traffic could shift away from Google Search."
