Summary: Meta Platforms Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg said that the social media company is going to keep spending on building out its infrastructure because the opportunity is so huge. "We don't expect Threads to be a meaningful driver of 2025 revenue at this time," Meta Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg told analysts on the company's conference call. "We don't have specifics to share about headcount growth in 2025," Chief Financial Officer Susan Li told analysts. Meta said its daily active user number was 3.29 billion on average for September, up 5%, but slightly lower than analysts had expected. Meta said it expects to see greater operating losses in its Reality Labs business for 2024, due to ongoing product development and investments to further grow its ecosystem.
