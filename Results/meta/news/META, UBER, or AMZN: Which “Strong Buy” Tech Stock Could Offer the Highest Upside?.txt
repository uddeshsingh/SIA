Summary: Moreover, the company increased its capital expenditure guidance for 2024, with CEO Mark Zuckerberg cautioning investors about a significant rise in AI infrastructure capex in 2025. The analyst believes that the company’s strong Q3 results reflect a stable macro backdrop, healthy user growth and engagement trends, and the benefits of AI in ad products and content recommendations. The company’s earnings per share (EPS) jumped to $1.20 from $0.10 in the prior-year quarter, reflecting the inclusion of a $1.7 billion benefit from unrealized gains related to the reevaluation of its equity investments. Looking ahead, Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi is confident about the company’s future and stated that the strength in its core business is supporting its organic investments in new products and capabilities to drive long term growth. Sheridan explained that UBER’s equity story is focused on its expanding end markets, rising profitability levels, and increased evidence of the cross-sell opportunities on the platform, which should help investors reconsider the company’s growth, margins, and free cash flow potential.
