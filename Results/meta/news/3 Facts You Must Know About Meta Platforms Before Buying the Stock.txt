Summary: Digital advertising giant Everyone knows Meta as the business that owns and operates some of the most popular social media platforms on the planet. Meta's impressive engagement, with the average Facebook, WhatsApp, and Instagram user spending more than 30 minutes per day on the platform, makes it a gold mine for advertisers to target. And given that the global digital ad market is forecast to grow at 15.5% per year on average through the end of this decade, Meta's expansionary days aren't over. The management team plans to spend up to $40 billion this year on capital expenditures, with that figure rising meaningfully in 2025 to bolster the tech infrastructure to power Meta's AI ambitions. As I mentioned earlier, Meta already has a gargantuan user base that represents 40% of the world population, giving it unrivaled distribution when launching new features.
