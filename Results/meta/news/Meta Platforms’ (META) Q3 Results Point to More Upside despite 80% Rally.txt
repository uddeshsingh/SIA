Summary: AI-Driven Recommendations Boosted Time Spent on Apps These metrics were driven by Meta’s focus on improving user experiences and its continued advances in AI. A good example is Meta’s AI-driven video suggestions, which have helped surface trending and engaging Reel content, keeping users active for longer periods. For example, Meta has pursued automation in data center management, thus reducing labor costs, optimizing resource allocation, and lowering operational expenditures. Conclusion Overall, Meta Platforms once again exhibited tremendous growth across its key operating metrics in Q3, driving impressive top and bottom line gains. With an ever-expanding user base, AI-powered tools that drive heightened engagement, and rising ad pricing trends, I believe Meta remains well-positioned for sustained long-term success.
Financial_Events: ['Moreover, the social media giant’s profits surged, a trend likely to persist, indicating that META stock remains attractive today', 'Now add the notable 11% increase in the average price per ad, and you get a 19% increase, bringing revenues of $40.6 billion, a new record for the social media giant.\nAI-Driven Recommendations Boosted Time Spent on Apps\nThese metrics were driven by Meta’s focus on improving user experiences and its continued advances in AI', 'In the post-earnings call, Mark Zuckerberg highlighted that AI-driven recommendations boosted time spent on Facebook by 8% and on Instagram by 6% this year alone.\nAI has also been critical in maintaining high engagement levels by delivering personalized and relevant content', 'In fact, Meta’s five-year average revenue CAGR of 18.1% indicates that the company is showing no signs of slowing down', 'I think it makes sense to remain optimistic about Meta’s future revenue growth', 'This kind of innovation is likely to keep fueling Meta’s top and overall monetization potential.\nProfitability Soars Due to Scale and Efficiencies\nMeta’s profits also surged in Q3, with operating income increasing by 26% year-over-year to $17.4 billion and its operating margin expanding to 43% from 40% last year', 'In turn, earnings surged by 35% year-over-year to $15.7 billion, while diluted EPS rose by 37% to $6.03, further aided by buybacks.\nSurging Profits Expose Meta’s Cheap Valuation\nDespite the stock’s prolonged rally over the past year, as I mentioned earlier, Meta’s surging profits make its current valuation appear notably cheap, in my view', 'At the current stock price, this implies a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of just 25.2', 'A similar scenario took place last year when Wall Street’s initial EPS estimate for 2024 was $17.33, significantly lower than the updated estimate of $22.51 today, which Meta will likely be able to beat, too.\nThus, I believe the market is underestimating Meta’s potential to sustain strong earnings growth']
