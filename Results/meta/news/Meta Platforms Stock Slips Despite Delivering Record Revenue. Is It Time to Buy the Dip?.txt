Summary: However, investor focus once again turned to spending, with the company indicating that it would continue to ramp up its capital expenditures (capex) to take advantage of the artificial intelligence (AI) opportunity it sees in front of it. Meta plans to add more features to help users stay up to date on topics they care about and believes it could become the next big social media app. Reality Labs has been a money drain on the company given the losses associated with it, while Meta plans to significantly ramp up capex next year in pursuit of AI growth. This is how Facebook and Instagram were built, and the company eventually was able to monetize its huge user bases through advertising to create the $1.5 trillion social media giant it is today. Meta should continue to benefit from the AI advancements it has made, which are leading to users spending more time on its platforms and more advertising dollars.
