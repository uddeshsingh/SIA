Summary: During the first half of the year, Tesla's profit margins fell to multiyear low levels, largely due to a decline in the automotive segment. Seth Goldstein Stock Analyst Note Tesla: Management Aims to Roll Out FSD to China and Europe in First Quarter of 2025 Tesla's artificial intelligence team announced its product release roadmap, which includes plans to launch its full self-driving software in Europe and China in the first quarter of 2025, pending regulatory approval. Shareholders voted with the board recommendations on nearly every proposal, including approving CEO Elon Musk's 2018 compensation package as well as reincorporating in the US state of Texas from Delaware. The rally was due to multiple media outlets reporting that Tesla cleared regulatory hurdles in China and was given tentative approval by the Chinese government to begin selling its full self-driving driver-assistance software (FSD). The move should drive Tesla sales higher in China, where the automaker is facing increasing competition with many electric vehicle manufacturers competing on lower prices.
