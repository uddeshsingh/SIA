Summary: Tesla's latest version of "Full Self-Driving" can back out of a spot, complete a journey and look for parking on the other end. In the four years since we’ve seen it both working perfectly and failing, but true full self-driving with no safety driver just seemed distant. What made us question FSD was Tesla’s decision to make the system only work on a combination of cameras and neural networks, ditching other types of sensors and radar. It looked big enough for a car to fit, in its defense, though it's hard to imagine a human making that mistake. Don’t forget this is a car with no ultrasonic sensors to gauge distance, which only makes its performance more impressive.
