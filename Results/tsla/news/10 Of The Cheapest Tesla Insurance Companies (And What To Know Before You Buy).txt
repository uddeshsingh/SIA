Summary: The United States Automobile Association (USAA) is a financial institution with insurance packages tailored specifically for Tesla owners who are part of the U.S. military. With a strong customer satisfaction rate and competitive prices, USAA is a popular choice among military-affiliated Tesla owners looking for dependable coverage at a low cost. Unlike other companies, Tesla leverages the vehicle's built-in data to provide real-time premiums based on driving behavior. Also, the company only has car insurance policy options, which means drivers can't get the usual bundling discounts provided by other competitors. While it can get pricier than its competitors, the company stands out for its comprehensive coverage options and generous discounts for bundling home and auto policies.
