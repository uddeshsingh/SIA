Summary: The native Apple Watch experience lets you view the charge status, pop the frunk, and remotely warm up your car. Another big new feature is the ability to view Dashcam and Sentry Mode recordings from your phone and save clips to your device to share crash footage with insurance or law enforcement quickly. There’s now a rear cross-traffic alert feature that gives drivers an audible warning and a red bar on their rearview camera feed if it detects cars or pedestrians coming from behind while in reverse. The update also lets you set “arrival energy at destination,” which means you can tell the Tesla how much battery charge you want at the end of the trip. Finally, there’s the ability to search for places on your route with detour time estimates, weather and precipitation indicators on the map for your destination, a new Sirius XM app (for Model 3, Y, Cybertruck), TuneIn app improvements, in-vehicle maintenance summaries, the ability to adjust unoccupied passenger seats from the screen, door handle pull alert notifications, and a new party game called Boomerang Fu among other features.
