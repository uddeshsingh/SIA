Summary: The stock surged as much as 7% on Friday to an intraday peak of $319.44, with shares soaring 27% since Donald Trump was declared the winner of the US presidential election. Tesla CEO Elon Musk was a huge backer of Trump's campaign in its final few months, donating over $100 million to efforts to reelect him. The massive gain in Tesla stock this week catapulted Musk to a net worth of about $300 billion, solidifying his position as the world's richest person, according to Bloomberg data. The Wedbush analyst Dan Ives said Trump's win, while potentially negative for the broader electric-vehicle sector, could significantly benefit Tesla. That's because while federal EV rebates and tax incentives are likely to be withdrawn during Trump's second term, Tesla is better suited than its competitors to navigate such a scenario.
