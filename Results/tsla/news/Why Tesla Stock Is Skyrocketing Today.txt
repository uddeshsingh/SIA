Summary: Why Tesla stock surged on Trump election victory While there isn't any fresh business-specific news for the EV leader today, CEO Elon Musk was an active supporter and campaigner for Trump in the election -- and some analysts think that the Republican's victory in the race will open opportunities for Musk's company. Ahead of the market opening today, the firm's analysts anticipated a strong bullish momentum for Tesla's share price in the day's trading and also highlighted the potential for longer-lasting positive catalysts for the company. While the costs for some parts could increase, tariffs could have the effect of making it harder for Chinese EVs to gain market share. The firm's analysts expect that EV rebates and tax incentives could be rescinded under the incoming administration. While this could hurt overall demand for EVs, it could actually strengthen Tesla's competitive positioning and make it more difficult for rivals to gain ground in the market.
