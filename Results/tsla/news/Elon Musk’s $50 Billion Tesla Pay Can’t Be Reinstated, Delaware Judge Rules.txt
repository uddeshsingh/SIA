Summary: A Delaware judge on Monday affirmed an earlier ruling that rescinded a giant pay package that Tesla had awarded its chief executive, Elon Musk. The judge, Chancellor Kathaleen St. J. McCormick of the Delaware Court of Chancery, struck down the award in January, ruling that shareholders had not been properly informed of its details and that members of Tesla’s board were not sufficiently independent. The pay comes from a 2018 award that said Mr. Musk would get all the options only if Tesla’s stock price soared and its sales and earnings grew strongly. The shareholder who brought the suit, Richard J. Tornetta, contended that Tesla’s board had not acted independently of Mr. Musk when devising the package and that the company had provided “materially misleading” information to investors. In her January ruling, after a trial in 2022, Chancellor McCormick said, “The process leading to the approval of Musk’s compensation plan was deeply flawed.” Thank you for your patience while we verify access.
