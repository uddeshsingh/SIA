Summary: An 18-year-old motorcycle driver was killed Saturday night in a collision with another vehicle in Westlake, the Palm Beach County Sheriff's Office reports. Investigators said Derek Hedrill Machin died after he was thrown from a 2018 Kawasaki Ninja shortly before 8 p.m. Saturday in a collision at Seminole Pratt Whitney Road and Town Center Parkway North. As he approached Town Center Parkway North, the driver of a southbound 2023 Tesla sedan began making a left turn, crossing into the Kawasaki's path. The collision caused the Tesla to rotate counterclockwise before coming to a stop in a northbound lane, the crash report said. Palm Beach County Fire Rescue medics pronounced Machin dead at the scene.
