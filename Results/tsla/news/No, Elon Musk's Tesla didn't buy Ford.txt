Summary: Rumors about Tesla making big acquisitions are always floating around the internet, although some of the latest are mainly generated by artificial intelligence rather than usual gossip. That includes fake products, like a “Tesla Home” and $500 laptops, or claims that Musk has found “proof” that giants are alive. For what it’s worth, Elon Musk Rewind does in its video’s description that it “contains information not to be considered the truth.” Other channels claim that Tesla is buying Jeep-maker Stellantis to “all competition,” releasing hydrogen-powered cars, and other obvious falsehoods. With President-elect Donald Trump heading to the White House, Musk is poised to have a sizable amount of influence over him, as well as an undefined role in slashing government spending. That’s already paying dividends, sending Tesla stock surging and its market cap past $1 trillion last week.
