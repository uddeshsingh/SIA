Summary: What Happened: The V4 Cabinet, Tesla said, supports 400V-1000V vehicle architectures and is capable of delivering up to 500kW for cars and 1.2 MW for the company’s upcoming Semi. While Tesla launched its V4 posts last year, it was still using a V3 cabinet, limiting power output. Superchargers already deliver over 5 TWh/year, 100 GWh/year in waste heat that can be saved.” This is equivalent to the annual electricity usage of over 9,000 households in the U.S. on average, according to data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration. Why It Matters: As of the end of the third quarter, Tesla had 6,706 supercharger stations around the globe and 62,421 connectors.
