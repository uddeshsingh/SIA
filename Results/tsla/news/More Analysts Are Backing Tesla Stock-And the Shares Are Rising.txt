Summary: Tesla (TSLA) shares rose Monday as two analysts offered optimistic outlooks for the electric vehicle maker. Roth Capital Partners upgraded the stock to “buy” from “neutral,” setting a price target of $380—,nearly $300 more than its previous position. In a note to clients, Roth said CEO Elon Musk’s close relationship with President-elect Donald Trump will likely increase demand for Tesla vehicles. The analysts, led by Stephen Gengaro, also pointed to Tesla’s self-driving technology, as well as its CyberCab robotaxi, according to reports. Wall Street's average price target is below current levels at near $280, according to Visible Alpha data.
