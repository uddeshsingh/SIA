Description: The $7,500 tax credit for buyers of electric vehicles could be vanishing early in the new Trump administration, but that might actually be good news for Tesla and its CEO Elon Musk, one of President-elect Donald Trump’s most prominent backers.

Summary: When Tesla sold a relatively small number of EVs back in the last decade, it also lost money – but it is now among the most profitable automakers. The Alliance for Automotive Innovation, an industry trade group which represents all of the major global automakers other than Tesla, wrote a letter to Congress in October, ahead of the election, urging that the tax credit remain in place. As legacy automakers have introduced more of their own EV models to American car buyers in recent years, Tesla’s sales have slowed. Musk, who donated $119 million to a political action committee supporting Trump’s campaign according to Federal Election Commission filings, is the world’s richest person, with a net worth of $307 billion based on Bloomberg’s Real Time Billionaire Tracker. Reuters, citing two sources with direct knowledge of the matter reported Thursday that Trump’s transition team is planning to kill the $7,500 credit as part of broader tax-reform legislation.
