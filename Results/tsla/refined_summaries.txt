Summary:
Tesla, a global company operating in multiple currencies, faces foreign currency risks primarily with the Chinese yuan and euro. They are a net receiver of currencies other than the U.S. dollar, and exchange rate fluctuations impact their U.S. dollar-denominated results without typical hedging. Adverse changes of 10% in all currencies could result in gains/losses of $1.01 billion (2023) and $473 million (2022) on monetary assets/liabilities.

The consolidated financial statements for 2023 and 2022 have been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, who concluded that the statements fairly represent Tesla's financial position and results of operations in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The auditor also confirmed effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023.

Tesla's total assets amounted to $106.618 billion in 2023, with current assets of $49.616 billion. Liabilities were $43.009 billion, with total stockholders' equity at $62.634 billion. The automotive segment accounted for the majority of revenues, cost of revenues, and operating expenses.

Notable changes in accounting principles include the 2021 change in convertible debt accounting. Critical audit matters included evaluating management's significant assumptions related to the automotive warranty reserve for certain Tesla vehicle models.

For the year ended December 31, 2023, Tesla reported net income of $14.974 billion, with basic and diluted net income per share of common stock at $4.73 and $4.30, respectively. Comprehensive income attributable to common stockholders was $15.215 billion.

Tesla's financial statements show the following key figures:

* For the year ended December 31, 2023, net income was $15,070 million, an increase from $12,689 million in 2022.
* Total revenues from sales and services were $94,133 million in 2023, a significant increase from $78,453 million in 2022.
* As of December 31, 2023, total assets were $63,367 million, including $34,892 million in property, plant, and equipment.
* As of December 31, 2023, total liabilities were $45,489 million, including $27,882 million in long-term debt.
* Stock-based compensation was $2,013 million in 2023, a slight decrease from $2,016 million in 2022.
* Cash flows from operating activities were $13,256 million in 2023, a decrease from $14,724 million in 2022.
* Cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash were $18,144 million as of December 31, 2023, a decrease from $19,901 million as of December 31, 2022.

The company's revenue is primarily generated from automotive sales, which includes revenues related to cash and financing deliveries of new vehicles, and specific other features and services that meet the definition of a performance obligation under ASC 606. Revenue from automotive sales is recognized upon delivery to the customer, while other features and services are recognized over time on a straight-line basis. The company also earns tradable credits in the operation of its automotive business under various regulations and sells these credits to other regulated entities.

In terms of assets, the company's balance sheet shows a significant amount of property, plant, and equipment, which was valued at $34,892 million as of December 31, 2023. The company's total liabilities were $45,489 million as of December 31, 2023, with a significant portion of that amount consisting of long-term debt.

Stock-based compensation was $2,013 million in 2023, a slight decrease from $2,016 million in 2022. Cash flows from operating activities were $13,256 million in 2023, a decrease from $14,724 million in 2022. Cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash were $18,144 million as of December 31, 2023, a decrease from $19,901 million as of December 31, 2022.

Overall, Tesla's financial statements show continued growth and strong financial performance, with an increase in net income and total revenues from sales and services in 2023 compared to 2022. However, the company's liabilities have also increased, and it is important to note the decrease in cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash from 2022 to 2023.

Tesla participates in various government programs, incentives, and other arrangements, including the IRA Incentives, Gigafactory New York State Investment and Lease, Gigafactory Shanghai Land Use Rights and Economic Benefits, Nevada Tax Incentives, and Gigafactory Texas Tax Incentives. These incentives reduce related costs and are recorded as reductions of expense or offsets to the related capital asset.

Tesla has entered into a 20-year agreement with Travis County, Texas, and a 10-year agreement with Del Valle Independent School District in Texas, which provide grant funding and tax exemptions for its Gigafactory Texas operations, subject to certain economic development metrics. These incentives are recorded as reductions in expenses in the company's financial statements.

Tesla offers a 401(k) savings plan in the U.S. and various savings plans internationally. As of January 2022, Tesla began matching 50% of employee contributions up to a maximum of 6% of their eligible compensation. In 2023 and 2022, Tesla recognized $99 million and $91 million, respectively, in expenses related to employer contributions for the 401(k) savings plan.

Three recent accounting pronouncements have been issued, which Tesla plans to adopt:

1. ASU No. 2023-07: Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures - This update requires disclosures of significant reportable segment expenses, the title and position of the Chief Operating Decision Maker, and an explanation of how the CODM uses the reported measures of a segment's profit or loss in assessing segment performance and deciding how to allocate resources.
2. ASU No. 2023-08: Accounting for and Disclosure of Crypto Assets - This ASU requires certain crypto assets to be measured at fair value separately in the balance sheet and income statement each reporting period and enhances the other intangible asset disclosure requirements.
3. ASU No. 2023-09: Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures - This ASU requires disaggregated information about a reporting entity's effective tax rate reconciliation and additional information on income taxes paid.

Tesla has adopted ASU No. 2021-08 and ASU No. 2022-02, which have not had a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.

Tesla's goodwill increased from $194 million in 2022 to $253 million in 2023, mainly due to a business combination. The net carrying value of its intangible assets decreased from $215 million in 2022 to $178 million in 2023, mainly due to amortization.

As of December 31, 2023, Tesla held digital assets with a carrying value of $184 million, reflecting cumulative impairment of $204 million. In 2023, Tesla recorded an immaterial amount of impairment losses on digital assets, while in 2022, it recognized $204 million in impairment losses and realized gains of $64 million.

Tesla's cash, cash equivalents, and investments as of December 31, 2023, totaled $29,094 million, with $15,903 million in cash and cash equivalents, and $12,696 million in short-term investments. The fair value of its financial instruments as of December 31, 2023, was $29,094 million.

Tesla's inventory as of December 31, 2023, was $13,626 million, compared to $12,839 million in 2022. The company writes down inventory for excess, obsolete, or lower net realizable value inventories.





Tesla's financials for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021 show significant growth. In 2023, Tesla had a total income before income taxes of $9,973 million, compared to $13,719 million in 2022 and $6,343 million in 2021. The provision for income taxes was $(5,001) million, $1,132 million, and $699 million for the respective years.

Tesla's EBITDA for 2023 was approximately $14,974 million, calculated as income before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization. This represents an increase from $14,591 million in 2022.

Total assets grew from $62,156 million in 2021 to $93,528 million in 2023, while total liabilities increased from $39,510 million in 2021 to $55,243 million in 2023. The company's net assets (equity) grew from $22,646 million in 2021 to $38,285 million in 2023.

In 2023, Tesla released a valuation allowance of $6.54 billion associated with U.S. federal and certain state deferred tax assets, leading to a decrease in the valuation allowance of $6.46 billion and an increase in net deferred tax assets of $9,882 million. Deferred tax assets, net of valuation allowance, stood at $6,652 million as of December 31, 2023.

Tesla had $10.31 billion of federal and $10.36 billion of state net operating loss carry-forwards available to offset future taxable income as of December 31, 2023. The company also held federal research and development tax credits of $1.10 billion, federal renewable energy tax credits of $605 million, and state research and development tax credits of $923 million.

Uncertain tax positions of $901 million, if recognized, would affect Tesla's effective tax rate. As of December 31, 2023, and 2022, the company had accrued $47 million and $31 million, respectively, related to interest and penalties on unrecognized tax benefits.

Tesla is currently under examination by the IRS for the years 2015 to 2018, with additional tax years within the periods 2004 to 2014 and 2019 to 2022 remaining subject to examination for federal income tax purposes. All net operating losses and tax credits generated to date are subject to adjustment for U.S. federal and state income tax purposes.

The company has operating lease arrangements in Buffalo, New York, and Shanghai, China, with specific requirements and potential penalties for failing to meet certain targets. Tesla is involved in several legal proceedings, including litigation relating to a 2018 CEO performance award, directors' compensation, and a potential going-private transaction.

Tesla is facing several legal issues and investigations, with financial implications that are difficult to estimate. These include:

1. Shareholder lawsuits: Several lawsuits have been filed against Tesla, its board of directors, and CEO Elon Musk in relation to a potential going-private transaction and SEC settlement. The cases have been stayed pending resolution of an appeal. A new lawsuit was filed in October 2021, alleging breach of fiduciary duties in connection with the 2018 SEC settlement. The case is stayed until March 2024.
2. JPMorgan Chase lawsuit: JPMorgan Chase filed a lawsuit against Tesla in 2021, claiming breach of a stock warrant agreement. JPMorgan seeks approximately $162 million, while Tesla has counterclaimed, asserting that JPMorgan should have terminated the agreement in 2018. The motion for judgment on the pleadings is currently pending.
3. Discrimination and harassment lawsuits: Tesla faces lawsuits and investigations related to alleged race discrimination, hostile work environment, and pay equity claims. These include a jury verdict for a former contingent worker, a civil complaint by the California Civil Rights Department, and an EEOC cause finding. Two derivative actions have also been filed, alleging breach of fiduciary duty and unjust enrichment related to discrimination and harassment.
4. Product and service lawsuits: Tesla is subject to various lawsuits seeking monetary and injunctive relief for purported defects and misrepresentations related to its products and services. These include proposed class actions about driver assistance technology systems and a case alleging misrepresentations about Autopilot and FSD Capability technologies.
5. Antitrust and warranty lawsuits: A proposed class action alleges that Tesla violates federal antitrust and warranty laws through its repair, service, and maintenance practices.
6. Regulatory investigations: Tesla regularly receives requests for information from regulators and governmental authorities, including the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, the National Transportation Safety Board, the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Department of Justice, and various local, state, federal, and international agencies.
7. Data incident: A foreign news outlet reported that it obtained misappropriated Tesla data, and a putative class action has been filed.

As of December 31, 2023, Tesla had $525 million of unused letters of credit outstanding and consolidated the financial position, results of operations, and cash flows of various variable interest entity (VIE) solar energy systems and vehicles.

Tesla intends to vigorously defend itself in these matters, but the outcome and impact are uncertain. The possible loss or range of loss cannot be reasonably estimated unless noted.
