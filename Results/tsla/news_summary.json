        "summary": "-- A Delaware judge has reaffirmed her ruling that Tesla must revoke Elon Musk\u2019s multibillion-dollar pay package Chancellor Kathaleen St. Jude McCormick on Monday denied a request by attorneys for Musk and Tesla\u2019s corporate directors to vacate her ruling earlier this year requiring the company to rescind the unprecedented pay package. The compensation package initially carried a potential maximum value of about $56 billion, but that sum has fluctuated over the years based on Tesla\u2019s stock price. Following the court ruling, Tesla shareholders met in June and ratified Musk\u2019s 2018 pay package for a second time, again by an overwhelming margin. Defense attorneys then argued that the second vote makes clear that Tesla shareholders, with full knowledge of the flaws in the 2018 process that McCormick pointed out, were adamant that Musk is entitled to the pay package. \u201cThe large and talented group of defense firms got creative with the ratification argument, but their unprecedented theories go against multiple strains of settled law,\u201d McCormick wrote in a 103-page opinion.",

The change in strategy coincidently, or not, came after Musk bought Twitter, a company relying on advertising, and Tesla even started to advertise on Twitter, now called X. Tesla sales in Korea haven\u2019t been amazing, but the country\u2019s auto market greatly favors domestic brands. The American automaker does fairly well for a foreign brand with the Model Y becoming the best-selling imported vehicle in Korea during the first half of 2024. Electrek\u2019s Take It\u2019s a change of strategy, and Elon certainly can\u2019t claim that Tesla doesn\u2019t pay for celebrities to endorse its products, but it is probably a smart move due to the fact that Koreans prefer domestic brands.

McCormick reads. At the time, McCormick said Musk had too much power over the agreement due to his close relationships with board members and the ties led to an \"unfair price.\" In late November, Business Insider reported that he'd broken his previous $340 billion wealth record after a Tesla stock surge following the presidential election. \"Contrary to how some have read the Post-Trial Opinion, the court did not find that the Board should have paid Musk nothing,\" McCormick wrote in her Monday filing. In the months that followed the judge's original ruling, Tesla campaigned for Musk's pay and eventually came away with approval from over 70% of the voting shares.",

Shareholders voted with the board recommendations on nearly every proposal, including approving CEO Elon Musk's 2018 compensation package as well as reincorporating in the US state of Texas from Delaware. The rally was due to multiple media outlets reporting that Tesla cleared regulatory hurdles in China and was given tentative approval by the Chinese government to begin selling its full self-driving driver-assistance software (FSD). The move should drive Tesla sales higher in China, where the automaker is facing increasing competition with many electric vehicle manufacturers competing on lower prices.",

Musk's legal team argued that McCormick should reverse her earlier decision because Tesla had conducted a shareholder vote to \u201cratify\u201d the 2018 pay plan at the company's annual shareholder meeting in June, per CNBC. \u201cWere the court to condone the practice of allowing defeated parties to create new facts for the purpose of revising judgments, lawsuits would become interminable,\" she wrote. The lawsuit was filed after Musk agreed in 2018 to spend the next decade working as Tesla's CEO or executive chairman and chief product officer in exchange for 20.3 million stock options that had an estimated value at the time of about $55 billion. The pay plan was considered the largest in U.S. history for a public CEO.",

Tesla runs out of gas The only piece of news that would have directly weighed on the stock was Hertz's announcement that it continues to see weak demand for EVs and will sell 30,000 of them by the end of the year. However, the main reason for today's sell-off seemed to be related to sentiment and valuation as Tesla's surge has come without any clear benefit to the business, and with the broader pullback in the market, investors seem to be saying the post-election rally has run out of steam. Tesla has soared in the aftermath of the election as CEO Elon Musk closely aligned himself with Trump, but it's not fully clear that getting in the president's good graces is going to benefit his EV company. Investors are ultimately hopeful that the Trump administration will loosen up rules around autonomy, making it easier for Tesla to roll out its new robotaxi, or Cybercab, but safety and public perception will be the most critical test for the vehicles.",

The stock has gained 47% in the last month, buoyed by investor optimism that President-elect Donald Trump's victory at the polls will help boost Tesla's prospects, given Musk's support for his campaign. Among the issues in their latest arguments, McCormick wrote, was a lack of procedural grounds for \"flipping the outcome of an adverse post-trial decision based on evidence they created after trial.\" Maryland island struggles to survive impact of rising sea level, erosion | 60 Minutes \"The Barn\": A murder in Mississippi, and the evil hiding in plain sight",

Tesla has said in court filings that the judge should recognize a subsequent June vote by its shareholders in favor of the pay package for Musk, the company's driving force who is responsible for many of its advances, and reinstate his compensation. \u201cWe are pleased with Chancellor McCormick\u2019s ruling, which declined Tesla\u2019s invitation to inject continued uncertainty into Court proceedings,\" said a statement from Bernstein Litowitz Berger & Grossmann, one of the three law firms for the plaintiff. Attorneys for shareholder Richard Tornetta, who sued in 2018 to challenge Musk's compensation package, had argued that Delaware law does not permit a company to use a ratification vote to essentially overturn the ruling from a trial. Musk's 2018 pay package gave him stock grants worth around 1% of Tesla's equity each time the company achieved one of 12 tranches of escalating operational and financial goals.",

Wedbush analyst Dan Ives pointed out that Trump could roll back the current electric vehicle tax incentives in place and be \"an overall negative for the EV industry.\" \"Tesla has the scale and scope that is unmatched in the EV industry, and this dynamic could give Musk and Tesla a clear competitive advantage in a non-EV subsidy environment, coupled by likely higher China tariffs that would continue to push away cheaper Chinese EV players (BYD, Nio, etc.) Ives added that a Trump win could also fast-track Tesla's full self-driving (FSD) initiatives. \"We believe a Trump win could add $40-$50 per share to Tesla's stock,\" he wrote, adding that the company could exceed $1 trillion in market cap \"if autonomous/FSD is accelerated starting in 2025.\"",

McCormick agreed with the argument that the board is too close to Tesla\u2019s CEO, noting that even Musk admitted that he only \u201cnegotiated against himself\u201d regarding his own compensation. He bet big in the 2024 presidential election, donating millions of dollars to Donald Trump\u2019s campaign and joining him on the trail.

Because the electric motor offers maximum torque from standstill, the Tesla only needs one gear to achieve lots of acceleration and ample top speed. While the city of Detroit, Michigan is the cradle of the North American car industry, electric-car maker Tesla has always marched to the beat of its own drum. So even though it\u2019s a US based entity, Tesla\u2019s worldwide view and its inherent mould-breaking attitude means that its factories are in some interesting locations. The new factory in Berlin, meanwhile, is very close to completion and will initially be used to build the Model Y. Tesla has always been a brand surrounded by rumours, and these days, these seem to involve a second Chinese plant.",

        "summary": "Why Tesla stock surged on Trump election victory While there isn't any fresh business-specific news for the EV leader today, CEO Elon Musk was an active supporter and campaigner for Trump in the election -- and some analysts think that the Republican's victory in the race will open opportunities for Musk's company. Ahead of the market opening today, the firm's analysts anticipated a strong bullish momentum for Tesla's share price in the day's trading and also highlighted the potential for longer-lasting positive catalysts for the company. While the costs for some parts could increase, tariffs could have the effect of making it harder for Chinese EVs to gain market share. The firm's analysts expect that EV rebates and tax incentives could be rescinded under the incoming administration. While this could hurt overall demand for EVs, it could actually strengthen Tesla's competitive positioning and make it more difficult for rivals to gain ground in the market.",

        "summary": "A Delaware judge ruled on Monday that Tesla TSLA.O CEO Elon Musk still is not entitled to receive a $56 billion compensation package despite shareholders of the electric vehicle company voting to reinstate it. The ruling by the judge, Chancellor Kathaleen McCormick of the Court of Chancery, follows her January decision that called the pay package excessive and rescinded it, surprising investors, and cast uncertainty over Musk's future at the world's most valuable carmaker. Tesla has said in court filings that the judge should recognize a subsequent June vote by its shareholders in favor of the pay package for Musk, the company's driving force who is responsible for many of its advances, and reinstate his compensation. More:Tesla leads November's global market value surge Attorneys for shareholder Richard Tornetta, who sued in 2018 to challenge Musk's compensation package, had argued that Delaware law does not permit a company to use a ratification vote to essentially overturn the ruling from a trial. Musk's 2018 pay package gave him stock grants worth around 1% of Tesla's equity each time the company achieved one of 12 tranches of escalating operational and financial goals.",

The judge, Chancellor Kathaleen St. J. McCormick of the Delaware Court of Chancery, struck down the award in January, ruling that shareholders had not been properly informed of its details and that members of Tesla\u2019s board were not sufficiently independent. The pay comes from a 2018 award that said Mr. Musk would get all the options only if Tesla\u2019s stock price soared and its sales and earnings grew strongly. The shareholder who brought the suit, Richard J. Tornetta, contended that Tesla\u2019s board had not acted independently of Mr. Musk when devising the package and that the company had provided \u201cmaterially misleading\u201d information to investors. In her January ruling, after a trial in 2022, Chancellor McCormick said, \u201cThe process leading to the approval of Musk\u2019s compensation plan was deeply flawed.\u201d Thank you for your patience while we verify access.",

He has said so many contradictory things, throughout his public life and during the presidential campaign, that it is easy to latch on to the bits you like and either ignore those you don\u2019t, or dismiss them as braggadocio. The former president\u2019s decisive victory on November 5th sparked a global rally in equities, as stockpickers filled the Trump-shaped hole in their vision of the future with hopes and dreams. In those reveries, lower taxes and less red tape propel the planet\u2019s biggest economy, and with it the economy of the planet as a whole. By the end of the week stocks were up by 2.4% globally relative to election day.",

While Tesla launched its V4 posts last year, it was still using a V3 cabinet, limiting power output. Superchargers already deliver over 5 TWh/year, 100 GWh/year in waste heat that can be saved.\u201d This is equivalent to the annual electricity usage of over 9,000 households in the U.S. on average, according to data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration. Why It Matters: As of the end of the third quarter, Tesla had 6,706 supercharger stations around the globe and 62,421 connectors.

Last year, notable Donald Trump fan (and probably upcoming cabinet member) Elon Musk said that Tesla would definitely build its new factory in Mexico, but the timeline would be dependent on the economy and interest rates. The former President and current President-elect Donald Trump said that he would impose tariffs of 200 percent or more on vehicles imported into the United States from Mexico, which surely has impacted the decisionmaking. Reuters said, \u201cMexico\u2019s economy chief will try to meet soon with Tesla\u2019s chief executive Elon Musk to determine his plans for an electric car factory in northern Mexico, he told local radio on Thursday, part of a push to grow the country\u2019s key carmaking sector Economy Minister Marcelo Ebrard is a former foreign minister and veteran political operator, and reviving plans for a so-called Tesla gigafactory in Mexico\u2019s Nuevo Leon state would mark a major early victory for the government of President Claudia Sheinbaum, who took office last month. Each of Tesla\u2019s Gigafactories are known to employ tens of thousands of people across Europe, China, and North America, so building and staffing Giga Mexico would be a significant boost to the Mexican economy.",

Another big new feature is the ability to view Dashcam and Sentry Mode recordings from your phone and save clips to your device to share crash footage with insurance or law enforcement quickly. There\u2019s now a rear cross-traffic alert feature that gives drivers an audible warning and a red bar on their rearview camera feed if it detects cars or pedestrians coming from behind while in reverse. The update also lets you set \u201carrival energy at destination,\u201d which means you can tell the Tesla how much battery charge you want at the end of the trip. Finally, there\u2019s the ability to search for places on your route with detour time estimates, weather and precipitation indicators on the map for your destination, a new Sirius XM app (for Model 3, Y, Cybertruck), TuneIn app improvements, in-vehicle maintenance summaries, the ability to adjust unoccupied passenger seats from the screen, door handle pull alert notifications, and a new party game called Boomerang Fu among other features.",

Perhaps the only automotive company CEO with a deep understanding of the issues regarding data engineering and software integration, Musk\u2019s technical acumen is unrivalled. For many years, as it was servicing R&D costs and scaling production, California\u2019s generous EV incentives and the US government\u2019s broader Co2 credits secured the cash flow to keep Tesla going. Tesla\u2019s Giga Shanghai factory accounts for nearly half of its global production capacity and Musk needs to ship those cars into the US without crippling tariffs. Musk probably won\u2019t get his way to sell cars directly in the several States where Tesla has clashed with legacy business (the dealership lobby), but he could benefit from a broader industry plea for restrained trade policy.",

The ruling by the judge, Chancellor Kathaleen McCormick of the Court of Chancery, follows her January decision that called the pay package excessive and rescinded it, surprising investors, and cast uncertainty over Musk\u2019s future at the world\u2019s most valuable carmaker. Tesla has said in court filings that the judge should recognize a subsequent June vote by its shareholders in favor of the pay package for Musk, the company\u2019s driving force who is responsible for many of its advances, and reinstate his compensation. \u201cWe are pleased with Chancellor McCormick\u2019s ruling, which declined Tesla\u2019s invitation to inject continued uncertainty into Court proceedings,\u201d said a statement from Bernstein Litowitz Berger & Grossmann, one of the three law firms for the plaintiff. Attorneys for shareholder Richard Tornetta, who sued in 2018 to challenge Musk\u2019s compensation package, had argued that Delaware law does not permit a company to use a ratification vote to essentially overturn the ruling from a trial.",

        "summary": "The stock surged as much as 7% on Friday to an intraday peak of $319.44, with shares soaring 27% since Donald Trump was declared the winner of the US presidential election. Tesla CEO Elon Musk was a huge backer of Trump's campaign in its final few months, donating over $100 million to efforts to reelect him. The massive gain in Tesla stock this week catapulted Musk to a net worth of about $300 billion, solidifying his position as the world's richest person, according to Bloomberg data. The Wedbush analyst Dan Ives said Trump's win, while potentially negative for the broader electric-vehicle sector, could significantly benefit Tesla. That's because while federal EV rebates and tax incentives are likely to be withdrawn during Trump's second term, Tesla is better suited than its competitors to navigate such a scenario.",

The CEO's remarks come nearly two weeks after Tesla held a splashy but strange press event at Warner Bros. Studios in Los Angeles, where it unveiled an autonomous robotaxi vehicle it calls the \"Cybercab\" alongside 6-foot tall semiautonomous humanoid robots. The news outlet noted that Waymo conducted millions of miles of testing over several years before receiving its first permit from the California agency that oversees ride-hailing services. It also said that though Texas has fewer regulatory requirements for autonomous vehicles when compared with California, companies \"often test for months or years before deploying paid services.\" Musk also proposed a Tesla robotaxi service back in 2019, saying the goal was to have a million such taxis in testing without passengers by the end of 2020 -- something that also didn't materialize.",

No, it\u2019s not quite there yet but if you include the $7,500 Commercial Clean Vehicle Credit, an AWD Cybertruck can be had for $72,490 before taxes and fees. \u201cThe Cybertruck is so unique and unprecedented that there is no benchmark for it and no way of knowing what its potential is,\u201d Tom Libby, an analyst at S&P Global Mobility, told me. Throw in the insatiable appetite for Cybertruck chatter on social media and you have a cultural phenomenon. \u201cI will say that I think people who dismiss it as being a fad and fading as soon as all the households with reservations have one, need to bear in mind that the Tesla brand remains very strong in the US market and needs to be taken seriously,\u201d Libby said.",

Tesla stands to make significant gains under a Trump administration with the threat of diminished subsidies for alternative energy and electric vehicles doing the most harm to smaller competitors. \u201cThis dynamic could give Musk and Tesla a clear competitive advantage in a non-EV subsidy environment, coupled by likely higher China tariffs that would continue to push away cheaper Chinese EV players.\u201d Tesla shares jumped 14.8% Wednesday while shares of rival electric vehicle makers tumbled. Subsidies for clean energy are part of the Inflation Reduction Act, signed into law by President Joe Biden in 2022. The U.S. opened an investigation into the company\u2019s \u201cFull Self-Driving\u201d system after reports of crashes in low-visibility conditions, including one that killed a pedestrian.",

A report from Tesla found that those trucks are or were equipped with a faulty drive inverter. \u201cIf the inverter stops producing torque, the driver loses the ability to apply torque to the vehicle using the accelerator pedal resulting in a loss of propulsion, which may increase the risk of a collision,\u201d reads Tesla\u2019s report.

If his cozy little nighttime chats with Putin weren\u2019t enough to prevent the Pentagon from using SpaceX to launch a network of spy satellites, it\u2019s hard to have much faith that the Harris administration won\u2019t continue her predecessor\u2019s policy of simply letting him get away with everything. Whether it\u2019s for show or something he actually believes, Musk\u2019s behavior on Twitter lately certainly suggests he isn\u2019t confident his status as the richest person in the world will keep him safe. In addition to all his other garbage tweets, Musk is also spreading the idea that Democrats plan to destroy him, and in his interview with TV dinner trust fund baby Tucker Carlson, said he\u2019s fucked if Trump loses. The country and the people will be better off under the Harris administration, but even before she has the chance to do any of that, it wouldn\u2019t be surprising to see millionaires and billionaires act like the sky is falling because they might not be able to afford to outfit a new private jet or bust unions and abuse workers without consequences.",

At the event, billed \"We, Robot,\" the multi-billionaire reiterated his view that fully self-driving vehicles will be safer than those operated by humans and could even earn owners money by being rented out for rides. Questions are being asked about Mr Musk's prediction that production of the Cybercab would begin some time \"before 2027\", given his track record of failing to meet his own deadlines. Tesla's self-driving ambitions rely on cameras that are cheaper than radar and Lidar (light detection and ranging) sensors that are the technology backbone of many competitors' vehicles. The sleek shuttle \"could be a mode of transportation over the coming years that Tesla leverages,\" said Wedbush Securities managing director Dan Ives who attended the event in person.",

BI further broke down the data to look at median base pay by job title, analyzing the numbers for full-time, US-based, salaried roles with at least five employees. Using separate data from the Securities and Exchange Commission, BI compared the company's median base pay with that of traditional automakers and the six largest tech firms by market cap. Greg Selker, a managing director at the executive recruitment firm Stanton Chase, told BI that while other Big Tech companies might have higher base pay and equity grants to match, Tesla's strength also lies in its image. Tesla's pay strategy has more in common with other Silicon Valley companies like Google or Meta than it does with traditional automakers, Harley Shaiken, an auto industry and labor expert, told BI.",

        "summary": "When Tesla\u2019s CEO, Elon Musk, endorsed former President Donald Trump, financially supported his reelection campaign, and even attended rallies in swing states, he upended a lot of the politics around electric vehicles (EVs). Most other U.S. manufacturers, such as Ford, GM, and Rivian (which received an investment of up to $5 billion from German carmaker Volkswagen), would likely face significantly tougher challenges in maintaining their EV offerings without such incentives. If you were looking to crush Tesla\u2019s competition through federal action, first on the chopping block would be policies put in place by the Biden administration to support established automotive component manufacturers to shift to EVs. A return to aggressive tariffs on Chinese goods under a Trump administration could impede not only sales but also Tesla\u2019s supply chain, as many of its components and raw materials such as batteries are sourced or refined in China. In retaliation, the EU would impose tariffs on American goods, potentially targeting key U.S. industries or sectors including companies that are gaining ground in Europe\u2019s EV market, such as Tesla.",

Skip to 1:33:13 It has been long rumored that Tesla is developing a smartphone that will separate itself from the duopoly of operating systems, Android and iOS. In fact, Musk has brought up the topic before as the Tesla CEO said in November 2022 that if Apple and Google decided to \"boot\" then-Twitter, and now X, from its respective app stores, Musk said there would be no other choice but to \"make an alternative phone. Now, on a recent episode of the JRE podcast, Musk was asked if there is any credibility to these rumors, or if he has ever considered making a smartphone. Musk added, \"Probably Tesla is in a better position to create a new phone that's not Android or iPhone than maybe any company in the world.",

Tesla CEO Elon Musk endorsed Trump's bid to return to the White House and was a prominent financial backer of his campaign. Trump has been critical of incentives and subsidies for EVs, but has commended Musk's work with Tesla and praised him as a \"super genius\" during his victory speech early Wednesday morning. Wall Street anticipates the incoming Trump administration will cut taxes and pursue a deregulatory agenda similar to the former president's first term in office. \"We believe a Trump win could add $40-$50 per share to Tesla's stock and exceed $1 trillion in market cap if autonomous/FSD is accelerated starting in 2025 and a tailwind for Cybercab,\" he added.",

In the four years since we\u2019ve seen it both working perfectly and failing, but true full self-driving with no safety driver just seemed distant. What made us question FSD was Tesla\u2019s decision to make the system only work on a combination of cameras and neural networks, ditching other types of sensors and radar. It looked big enough for a car to fit, in its defense, though it's hard to imagine a human making that mistake. Don\u2019t forget this is a car with no ultrasonic sensors to gauge distance, which only makes its performance more impressive.",

        "summary": "EV giant Tesla Inc TSLA has opened the option to lease a Cybertruck in the U.S. for as low as $999 a month. However, the company has now opened the option for customers to lease the lower-priced variant of the electric stainless steel truck for three years for an estimated $999 per month. The company started delivering the vehicle to customers in the U.S. late in November 2023 and in Mexico and Canada this year. According to data from automotive research company Kelley Blue Book, Tesla sold 16,692 Cybertrucks in the third quarter in the U.S., trumping EV trucks from rivals including the Ford F-150 Lightning and the Rivian R1T, to become the third best-selling EV behind Model Y and Model 3.

Now that bet has paid off, giving Mr. Musk a direct line to the White House that he may be able to use to bend policy in ways that could benefit Tesla, his electric car company. It is too early to say how much of Mr. Musk\u2019s newly acquired political capital he will allocate to Tesla as opposed to his other businesses like SpaceX, a major government contractor, or xAI, an artificial intelligence start-up. But investors clearly believe that a Trump administration will be good for Tesla, despite the president-elect\u2019s often-expressed disdain for electric vehicles and renewable energy. The safety agency is investigating whether a Tesla system that the company calls \u201cfull self-driving (supervised)\u201d was responsible for four collisions, including one that killed a pedestrian.",

Reuters' report added that Tesla representatives in touch with Trump's team support ending the subsidy. Tesla stock opened Thursday's session lower as the Trump trade rally was showing signs of fatigue. On Monday, Tesla shares reached their highest level since early 2022, with Wall Street analysts growing increasingly bullish on Musk's connection to an incoming Trump administration. This week, Trump announced Musk and former GOP presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy would co-lead a new group to cut government waste.",

To be sure, the price staged a decisive volume-backed breakout on Wednesday, signaling conviction behind the move and potentially opening the door for further upside. Moreover, the relative strength index (RSI) confirms bullish price momentum with a reading approaching 70, but also points to nearing overbought conditions that could lead to short-term profit taking. Let\u2019s look at key overhead price levels on Tesla\u2019s chart that could come into play and also identify a couple of important support areas to monitor. Investors could seek buying opportunities in this area near a horizontal line connecting a range of comparable price action on the chart between November 2023 and September this year.",

            "Tesla shares have more than doubled from their April low, boosted in part by optimism surrounding the automaker\u2019s robotaxi ambitions and plans to start production next year on a lower cost model vehicle.\nBelow, we take a closer look at Tesla's chart and use technical analysis to identify important price levels worth watching out for.\nAscending Triangle Breakout\nSince reaching their 2024 high in July, Tesla shares have traded within an ascending triangle, a bullish chart pattern that indicates a continuation of the stock\u2019s uptrend that started in April.\nTo be sure, the price staged a decisive volume-backed breakout on Wednesday, signaling conviction behind the move and potentially opening the door for further upside.\nMoreover, the relative strength index (RSI) confirms bullish price momentum with a reading approaching 70, but also points to nearing overbought conditions that could lead to short-term profit taking.\nLet\u2019s look at key overhead price levels on Tesla\u2019s chart that could come into play and also identify a couple of important support areas to monitor.\nKey Overhead Levels to Watch\nFirstly, it\u2019s worth keeping an eye on the $300 level, a location on the chart where the shares could run into selling pressure near the psychological round number and prominent July 2023 swing high.\nTo project an overhead level above this area, we can apply the measuring principle",
            "In this case, we add $85 and $265, which forecasts an upside target of $350, an area where chart-based investors may consider locking in profits.\nImportant Support Areas to Monitor\nDuring declines, investors should initially monitor the $265 level, where the shares could attract buying interest near the ascending triangle\u2019s top trendline, a chart region that may flip from an area of prior resistance into future support.\nFinally, a deeper retracement could see Tesla shares revisit lower support around $230"

Key Facts Crucial Quote \u201cElon Musk\u2019s emergence from a political \u2018outsider\u2019 to having a voice in potential policies may, at some level, accelerate Tesla\u2019s journey beyond autos,\u201d wrote Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas in a Tuesday note to clients. American leadership in Tesla\u2019s core ambitions like electric and autonomous vehicles, solar energy and robotics \u201cis going to involve government and industrial partnership on a scale some have compared to the Manhattan Project, US Highway Act or the Apollo Missions,\u201d Jonas added. Yu outlined several near-term factors behind the surge, including \u201cretail exuberance\u201d and short trade unwinding \u201cdue to lack of near-term negative catalysts.\u201d But Yu wrote there are \u201cpotential large\u201d benefits for Tesla under a Trump regime with Musk a close advisor, including \u201cstreamlining\u201d regulatory approval of Tesla\u2019s self-driving cars and the potential for Tesla to secure further market share in the U.S. with the potential cutback of federal tax credits for electric vehicles. Tesla stock led a broader rally for U.S. equities since the election, with the S&P up 4% over the last week, trading above 6,000 for the first time ever as Wall Street celebrated the positive earnings impact of the lower corporate tax rates backed by Trump.",

            "When an earlier version of the tax credit phased out several years ago, Tesla was forced to cut prices on its vehicles by roughly half of the amount of the credit its buyers were no longer getting.\nTesla, the world\u2019s largest maker of EVs, is the only automaker making a profit on its US EV sales",
            "When Tesla sold a relatively small number of EVs back in the last decade, it also lost money \u2013 but it is now among the most profitable automakers.\nSo if the EV tax credit goes away, the price of all EVs might come down",
            "But that would only reduce Tesla profits, not increase losses the way it might at established automakers trying to get into the market",
            "Some of those automakers might even pull back on their EV production and sales in order to limit the losses, which would mean less competition among EV buyers for Tesla.\nEven with the EV tax credit in place, Tesla and Musk have used this greater profitability to cut prices on his EVs in order to support demand in the face of greater competition and to put pressure on his established automaker rivals.\n\u2018It will only help Tesla\u2019\nMusk signaled during the campaign that he would support ending the EV tax credit, even if raised the cost of Tesla purchases for American buyers.\n\u201cTake away the subsidies, it will only help Tesla,\u201d he posted on his social media platform X in July.\nBut the rest of the auto industry wants to keep the tax credit in place",
            "Tesla (TSLA) shares rebounded a bit in premarket trading Friday.\nThe end of the credit \u201cwill widen Tesla\u2019s competitive moat by making competing EV models even more uneconomic, as we believe TSLA is the only profitable manufacturer of EVs,\u201d wrote Garrett Nelson, analyst for CFRA Research, in a note to clients the day after the election"

Tesla boss Elon Musk has been among the most high profile champions of cryptocurrency, with his pronouncements on social media often driving significant trading activity. Tesla's $1.5bn investment in Bitcoin, revealed in February 2021, prompted a surge of demand in the currency. Whether it's promising driverless tech or buying social media companies, Mr Musk's pronouncements don't always come to pass. However, the company reported higher-than-expected profit for the three months to the end of June as price increases of its best-selling cars helped offset challenges, including lockdowns in China.",
