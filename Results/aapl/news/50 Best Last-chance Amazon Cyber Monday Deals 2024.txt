Summary: In fact, the Rockland Journey Softside Upright 4-piece Luggage Set is one of the best last-chance deals we’ve spotted at a staggering 57 percent off, providing every bag size you could possibly need at only $24 apiece. At 33 percent off, the Travel Select Amsterdamn Expandable Luggage 4-piece Set is one of the best ways to stock up on suitcases of varying sizes while sticking to your budget, while the compact Travelpro Maxlite 5 Softside Lightweight Underseat Carry-on is another must-have at $68. Featuring a flattering pair of wide-leg pants alongside an oversized turtleneck sweater, this duo can be styled together or separately, expanding your outfit potential twofold. They’ve earned more than 12,600 five-star ratings from happy Amazon shoppers, plus, they’re packable, made with a comfy elastic waistband, and feature an impressive collection of zippered pockets. The Findway Ski Goggles are a steal at $20 to round out Cyber Monday, but if you’re already looking ahead to warmer weather, it’s the Roc Inflatable Stand Up Paddle Board that should make it into your cart.
