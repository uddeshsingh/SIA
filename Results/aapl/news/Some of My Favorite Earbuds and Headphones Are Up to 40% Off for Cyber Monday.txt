Summary: I manage the Consumer Electronics Reviews team at PCMag, so I am intimately familiar with a wide range of devices, from Bluetooth headphones to mobile phones, smart home products, tablets, and beyond. The Best Noise-Cancelling Earphone Deal Apple's AirPods Pro 2 set a performance benchmark for iPhone owners. This iconic in-ear pair is light, easy to wear, and feature deep integration with Apple's smartphones, tablets, and computers. These in-ear, noise-cancelling earphones support a range of advanced codecs for high-resolution playback, particularly if you're using an Android phone. These over-ear cans are supremely comfortable to wear all day longâ€”and that's about how long they'll last, thanks to more than 60 hours of battery life with noise-cancelling on.
