Summary: However, in an interesting turn of events, rather than updating the Apple Watch Ultra 2 and the AirPods Pro, Apple has given this hardware a new lease on life by adding new features such as sleep apnea detection for the Ultra 2 and a clinical hearing aid feature for the AirPods Pro. Apple TV: Last updated in October 2022, this device is due for a refresh, possibly alongside the iPhone, so unless you desperately need a new one, wait a few months. Apple iPad Mini The all-new 2024 iPad Mini replaces the three-year-old model with one powered by an A17 Pro chip that's Apple Intelligence ready, and comes in a range of colors (blue, purple, starlight, and space grey) and storage capacities (128GB, 256GB, and 512GB) to suit everyone. Apple has now refreshed the charging case to use USB-C rather than Lightning -- great if you have a new iPhone, but yet another cable or dongle to carry if not. Also: How to find out if an AirTag is tracking you Well-made, robust, and with a replaceable battery, these will make misplaced keys or lost wallet things of the past.
