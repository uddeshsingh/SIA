Summary: With the integration of Apple Pay, Coinbase is continuing to push its products toward the average consumer by making crypto purchases more accessible. President-elect Trump has signaled his incoming administration would be kinder to the crypto industry than previous leaders, which has undoubtedly pushed the price of bitcoin to nearly $100,000. Securities and Exchange Commission chair Gary Gensler recently announced he would step down when Trump takes office, marking an end to his years-long crackdown on crypto. Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong previously criticized Apple for not playing nice with the crypto industry, alleging in 2022 that there could be antitrust issues for the iPhone maker. Earlier this year, the Cupertino-based company pulled Binance, Kraken, and several of the worldâ€™s largest crypto exchanges from its App Store in India.
