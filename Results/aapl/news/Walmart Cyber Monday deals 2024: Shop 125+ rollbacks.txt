Summary: The big-box store's sale features lingering deals from its Black Friday event last week, including $154 Apple AirPods Pro 2, $29 JLab ANC headphones, a $178 55-inch 4K TV, and $30 digital copies of The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom. Mashable's team of deal-hunting pros knows how to distinguish good discounts from duds, having covered Cyber Weekend sales for nearly a decade, and we're keeping a running list of Walmart's top holiday deals on popular tech and gifts this season. Keep scrolling to see our picks, and check back often: Walmart is dropping additional deals randomly during its holiday sales this year. Walmart has been a trendsetter this Cyber Weekend: After it dropped the AirPods Pro 2 down to a record-low of $154 during its second Black Friday deals event (normally $249), other retailers like Amazon and Target swiftly followed suit. Twenty-nine bucks is a surprisingly and stupidly low price on a solid pair of comfy budget headphones with good noise cancellation and a long battery life.
