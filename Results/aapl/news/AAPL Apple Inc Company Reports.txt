Summary: We continue to expect strong revenue growth in fiscal 2025 as users upgrade their iPhones to take advantage of Apple’s generative artificial intelligence features, requiring the latest and greatest hardware. In the long term, we maintain our view that Apple can drive growth from its unique combination of hardware, software, and services that also elicits steep customer switching costs and underpins our wide moat rating. We maintain our $150 fair value estimate and view shares as modestly overvalued as we don’t foresee massive hardware growth out of existing products like the iPhone in the years ahead. We maintain our $150 fair value estimate for Apple, as we don’t envision the company selling enough units of these devices to move the needle on its massive valuation, which is still dominated by the far more pervasive iPhone. This expertise, coupled with its walled garden approach for its unique iOS ecosystem, enables the firm to capture a premium on its devices, unlike most of its peers that rely on open operating systems, Windows and Android, in particular.
