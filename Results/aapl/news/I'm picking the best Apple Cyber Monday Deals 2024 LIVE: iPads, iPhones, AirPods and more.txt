Summary: It's remarkably light and thin, yet sports a 13.6-inch Liquid Retina display, a speedy Apple M2 CPU w/ 8-core GPU, 8GB of RAM, 256GB SSD and a great 1080p FaceTime camera. It's remarkably light and thin, yet sports a 13.6-inch Liquid Retina display, a speedy Apple M2 CPU w/ 8-core GPU, 8GB of RAM, 256GB SSD and a great 1080p FaceTime camera. I've been a customer for years now because of their low-cost wireless plans, but this Cyber Monday iPhone deal comes bundled with a $250 gift card, which you can in turn use on the service (or on a future phone purchase). One nice bonus to that Cricket plan: it includes a free subscription to the ad-supported tier of the Max streaming service, something you won't find at a lot of other carriers. It can potentially detect dangerous events like heart irregularities or falls and crashes, or keep tabs on key health metrics to see how things change over time.
