Summary: With Palantir and Nvidia looking like two of the AI realm's most dominant forces, would you be surprised to learn that some of Wall Street's brightest minds are only buying one of these stocks right now? The advent of AIP has catapulted Palantir into the forefront of the AI narrative, helping the company accelerate revenue across both the commercial and public sectors, all while achieving notable margin expansion and consistent profitability. As the chart above illustrates, the company has experienced notable valuation expansion throughout 2024 and has emerged as one of the priciest software-as-a-service (SaaS) stocks among its peers. In my eyes, the two most obvious catalysts fueling Nvidia's bull case thesis over the next few years are rising investment in AI-related infrastructure combined with the upcoming launch of the company's next generation GPU architecture, Blackwell. NVDA PE Ratio data by YCharts While Nvidia's valuation isn't cheap per se, the company's current price-to-earnings (P/E) and price-to-free-cash-flow (P/FCF) multiples are trading relatively in line with 10-year averages.
