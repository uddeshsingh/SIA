Summary: While it has a far more slender content library than giants like Netflix and Prime Video, the service has maintained an affordable price point. Among the best Apple TV shows include huge hits like Severance, Silo, and Ted Lasso, the latter of which has been rumored to return for another season despite looking like it had come to an end. From Oscar darlings CODA and Killers of the Flower Moon to documentaries like The Last of the Sea Women, there are plenty of best Apple TV movies to sink your teeth into. If you'd love to learn more about why Apple TV Plus won TechRadar's Streaming Service of the Year award in 2024, you'll need to get yourself a free trial. The blue bar at the bottom of the screen has a button that reads "accept free trial", simply click on that to get started.
