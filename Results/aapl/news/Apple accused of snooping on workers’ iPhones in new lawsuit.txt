Summary: An Apple worker is suing the company over claims it requires employees to waive their right to privacy and subjects them to surveillance, as first reported by Semafor. Under company policy, the data linked to these Apple-managed devices, including emails, photos, videos, notes, and other information, are “subject to search by Apple,” according to the lawsuit. Additionally, the lawsuit claims that Apple breaks California law by requiring employees to agree to a policy that allows it to “engage in physical, video, and electronic surveillance” of them, as well as gives it the ability to search Apple and non-Apple devices on “company premises,” which, in some instances, could allegedly involve a worker’s home office. This isn’t the first time we’ve heard about these policies, as a 2021 report from The Verge revealed concerns about data privacy among Apple workers forced to link their personal accounts and devices to their jobs. The National Labor Relations Board accused Apple of barring employees from talking about pay equity last month.
