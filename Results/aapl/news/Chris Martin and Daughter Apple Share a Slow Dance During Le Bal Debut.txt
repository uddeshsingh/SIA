Summary: On Saturday, Nov. 30, the 20-year-old daughter of the Coldplay frontman, 47, and his ex-wife Gwyneth Paltrow, 52, made her society debut at the Le Bal des Débutantes in Paris. At the event, Chris and Apple were spotted sharing a slow dance in a sweet video from Paris Match. The third slide showed a snap seemingly featuring Martin and their son Moses, 18, as they sat on a bench outside with their backs toward the camera. The sweet photo was followed by a family picture of Paltrow, her mother Blythe Danner, and Moses in a white room with art pieces hanging behind them. The Iron Man alum wore a glittery sheer black gown from Valentino’s spring 2025 collection for the occasion.
