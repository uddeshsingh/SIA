Summary: The Coldplay singer, 47, shared a slow dance with Apple, 20, as part of her introduction into formal society in Paris on Friday, November 30. Both Martin and his ex-wife, Gwyneth Paltrow, were in France over the weekend to celebrate Apple’s high-society debut at the Shangri-La Hotel. The college student wore a blue Valentino gown with tiers of silk plissé chiffon and a black bow at the waist. The Iron Man actress shared a selfie before the gala with Apple and later snapped a picture with Moses, 18, Martin and Danner, 81, inside the lavish ballroom. “Chris and I committed to putting them first and that’s harder than it looks because some days you really don’t want to be with the person that you are getting divorced from,” Paltrow said during a September 2020 appearance on The Drew Barrymore Show.
