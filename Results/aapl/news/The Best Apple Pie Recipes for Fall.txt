Summary: Perry creates a traditional dessert that exudes sweet-tart apples in a perfectly buttery shell. Stacked cinnamon apple slices are topped first with homemade caramel and then with a brown sugar streusel. An aromatic apple filling is swirled into vanilla ice cream, then the mixture gets sandwiched between two homemade cookies. A filling of sugared apples creates a delicious canvas for adding your favorite spices as desired. The paper grocery bag traps in all the moisture, creating the perfect conditions for tender apples nestled in a crisp, golden crust.
