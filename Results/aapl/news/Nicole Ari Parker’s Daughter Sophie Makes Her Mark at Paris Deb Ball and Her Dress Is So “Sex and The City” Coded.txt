Summary: The annual event introduces about 20 women between the ages of 16 and 22 into society, with fellow celeb kids like Lily Collins and Margaret Qualley having participated in recent years. The sculptural number featured a balloon skirt that gathered on one side to reveal a thigh-high slit — a silhouette that would make Carrie Bradshaw very proud. ✨," Parker, 54, captioned an Instagram post showing video clips of Sophie entering the ball with her escort and dancing with her father, Boris Kodjoe. Apple's blue chiffon Valentino gown reportedly took Creative Director Alessandro Michele’s atelier 750 hours to make. Lucia, whose parents are Grey's Anatomy star Sasha Alexander and Italian film director Edoardo Ponti, opted for a strapless gown by Giorgio Armani Privé, per Vogue.
