Description: iTunes and the iPod revolutionized the music industry in the early 2000s, as the hardware and software duo which popularized singles over albums and allowed users to store thousands of songs on a single device. That now seems quaint, but for over a decade it was the way most people listened to music. Apple held a lead over all other music players with the iPod, which was catapulted further ahead by the iPhone. However, Apple failed to see music streaming as the next evolution of digital music, with CEO Steve Jobs vehemently against it. Instead, for half a decade, a small Swedish developer was able to grow with hardly any serious competition. Spotify had already accumulated 22 million subscribers by the time Apple Music launched.
