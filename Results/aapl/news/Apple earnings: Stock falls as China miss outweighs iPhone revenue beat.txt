Summary: Apple posted a headline beat on Thursday for the fiscal fourth quarter, but investors may have found at least one item to nitpick. "Every time we plan for the upcoming year we think about all the different areas where we can deploy our resources and we make them available to grow the business," Maestri said Thursday. Capex, or capital expenditures, is a hot term in the technology world lately, as big companies rush to spend up on artificial-intelligence infrastructure. Apple saves its outlook for the earnings call, and management just shared an expectation for low- to mid-single-digit growth in total revenue for the holiday quarter. Apple also expects a double-digit growth rate for services revenue similar to what the company posted for fiscal 2024, when the category grew 12.9%.
