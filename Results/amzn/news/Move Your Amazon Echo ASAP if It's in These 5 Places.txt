Summary: Amazon Echo speakers come in all shapes, sizes and types, making these devices great for putting all around the house... or even the car. Not to worry because we have a helpful list of where you should avoid placing your Echo devices, and the best spots for them to go instead. Just make sure it's secure so it doesn't fall, and remember to place it near an outlet so you can plug it in. Instead, place it on a different counter, like a kitchen island, or tuck it into a corner where it's farther from splattering spaghetti sauce and water spray. On a mantle or shelf On your bedside table Mounted on a wall not facing a window In the corner of your living room (away from windows) On the edge of your kitchen counter far away from your sink A place easily visible so you can see when the light ring lights up You can also read our story on the four best uses for your Amazon Echo device in each room of your home to help you decide where to place your Echo.
