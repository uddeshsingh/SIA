Summary: And trust me, these deals make it easier than ever to enjoy top-tier content without breaking the bank — especially with these unbeatable Cyber Monday savings. Max is our favorite streaming service, so this is a great deal, and as it's a 6-month plan it's perfect for those who don't want the upfront commitment of a 12-month subscription. In our Fubo TV review, we pointed out how expensive this service is, so this $30 off deal for your first month is a much cheaper way to watch some great sport. It's usually £7.99, so this deal will save you £12 and give you access to a huge array of classics, like South Park and Frasier, as well as Paramount movies and new originals content. Stay tuned to our live coverage of Cyber Monday deals to ensure you don’t miss out on any of the best discounts as they roll in throughout the day.
