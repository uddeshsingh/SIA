Summary: In an announcement Wednesday, Dharmesh Mehta, vice president of Amazon's Worldwide Selling Partner Services, said the new service aims to offer customers low-priced products across various categories while ensuring authenticity and safety. "Finding great products at very low prices is important to customers, and we continue to explore ways that we can work with our selling partners so they can offer products at ultra-low prices," he said, adding that the company will continue to refine the service based on customer feedback.
