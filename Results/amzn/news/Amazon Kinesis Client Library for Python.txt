Summary: In this release, we have abstracted these implementation details away and exposed an interface that enables you to focus on writing record processing logic in Python. This approach significantly reduces read operations compared to earlier KCL versions, where workers performed full table scans, resulting in higher RCU consumption. If CPU utilization metric is not available, KCL assigns leases to balance the total sum of shard throughput per worker instead. This polling configuration property determines the publishers wait time between GetRecords calls in both success and failure cases. The following operations are newly added in KCL 3.x: LeaseAssignmentManager WorkerMetricStatsReporter LeaseDiscovery We found an issue with the release 3.0.0 regarding the build failure.
