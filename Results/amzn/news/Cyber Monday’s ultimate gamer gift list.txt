Summary: As the holiday season begins to light up like an Xbox home button, Cyber Monday is the perfect time to grab the ultimate gamer gifts. I’ve put together a fool-proof list of gift ideas for the gamer in your life, whether they’re playing on Xbox, exploring titles on a Steam Deck, grinding on the ROG Ally, or diving deep into PC gaming. From Xbox Series X|S consoles and sleek transparent controllers to wireless headsets and stocking fillers under $10, these picks are guaranteed to hit the mark. Forget the fleece "Sleep, Game, Repeat" blanket from your Nan or the dodgy controller from Temu—these choices are all about quality AND fun. So, whether you're shopping for a gamer friend or treating yourself (we won’t judge), this list has everything you need to make the season bright—and your gaming gear brighter.
