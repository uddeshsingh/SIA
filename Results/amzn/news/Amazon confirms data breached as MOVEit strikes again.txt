Summary: Amazon employees' data is part of a stolen trove posted to a cybercrime forum linked to last year's MOVEit vulnerability. The stolen data was noted by cybercrime intelligence company Hudson Rock, which detailed that it was related to CVE-2023-34362, a critical vulnerability discovered mid-2023 in file transfer software MOVEit. "The directories contain detailed employee information, including names, email addresses, phone numbers, cost center codes, and, in some cases, entire organizational structures," it wrote. Schneider Electric ransomware crew demands $125k paid in baguettes China's Volt Typhoon reportedly breached Singtel in 'test-run' for US telecom attacks US government hit by Russia's Clop in MOVEit mass attack White House report dishes deets on all 11 major government breaches from 2023 Although many companies were listed as being affected, including HP, Applied Materials, 3M, Lenovo, British Telecom, and more, Amazon was named as having the most exposed records â€“ over 2.86 million of the more than 5 million records. This may be because the MOVEit vulnerability was identified as originally hacked by the Cl0p ransomware group, even though the data now being offered on BreachForums by Nam3L3ss was not involved in a previous leak.
