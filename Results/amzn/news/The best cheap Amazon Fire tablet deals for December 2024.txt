Summary: If you're looking to browse the web, catch up on some media streaming, play some simple games, keep the youngsters entertained with one of the bespoke Kids versions, or simply grab one of the best cheap tablets for an alternative to the Kindle ereader, a device in the Amazon Fire range is the ultimate affordable buy. The Fire HD 8 is the ideal middle-of-the-road option as it's still relatively cheap at $99.99 / £99.99 but offers a larger 8-inch display and a 30% performance upgrade over the previous model. And then last up is the latest Fire 11 Max with its 11-inch display, powerful performance, solid 14-hour battery life and decent storage options of 64GB or 128GB from $229.99 / £249.99. Lastly, the Fire HD 10 Kids is the most expensive of the lot at $199.99 / £209.99 but offers performance upgrades and the biggest display for those after the best browsing, streaming and gaming experience. However, if you do pick up the cheaper model and regret your decision, you can pay the difference to have those lock screen offers removed as well.
