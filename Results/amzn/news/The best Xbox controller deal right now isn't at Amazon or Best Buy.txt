Summary: Xbox controllers go on sale often enough that I'd never spend $60 on one, but I'd pull the trigger at around $45. With certain Xbox Controllers down to $34.99 at Lenovo (use code BFCMXBOX at checkout), I'm contemplating picking one up as a backup just in case I ever decide to return to my more aggressive Rocket League playing days, which weren't kind to the analog sticks. The price listed on the website is $39.99, and you won't see the full discount until you apply the code in your shopping cart. (You'll see a different code automatically applied when you go to checkout at Lenovoâ€”make sure to enter BFCMXBOX in the "Have an eCoupon or discount?" ðŸ‘‰ We're curating the best Black Friday PC gaming deals right here ðŸ‘ˆ Lenovo's beating the competition here: Amazon and Best Buy's best price for Xbox controllers during Black Friday and Cyber Monday has been $39.99.
