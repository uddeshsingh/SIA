The CDW Digital Velocity business currently provides services around automated infrastructure, practical DevOps, modern cloud, software and enterprise architecture, agile team integration, and rapid resourcing of necessary talent. Until its acquisition by CDW, Mission Cloud Services was owned by Great Hill Partners, a Boston-based private equity firm that has raised over $12 billion of commitments and invested in over 100 companies. “The acquisition of Mission accelerates our three-part growth strategy by augmenting our cloud services and enhancing our ability to deliver customer-centric outcomes across the full technology solutions stack and lifecycle. We look forward to welcoming the talented Mission team to CDW and leveraging their robust cloud, security, and AI expertise to lead the market and deliver on our purpose – to make technology work so people can do great things.” Becoming part of CDW is an important part of scaling Mission Cloud Services’ dedicated AWS practice, said Simon Anderson, chairman, founder, and CEO of the Los Angeles area-based company (pictured above), in a prepared statement: “As an AWS Premier Tier Partner, we are strategically positioned to help CDW's extensive customer network embrace and accelerate building on AWS and optimize their technology investments and AI-driven innovation.”
