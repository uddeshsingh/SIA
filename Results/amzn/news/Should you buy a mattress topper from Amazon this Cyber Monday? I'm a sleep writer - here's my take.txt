Summary: If you're shopping for cheap Cyber Monday mattress topper deals, I'm going to assume you're turning to Amazon. I'll also compare buying a mattress topper rom Amazon vs directly from the brand and which offers the best Cyber Monday deals overall. While some brands take up to five to seven days to ship and deliver toppers, you may have to wait longer or pre-order on high-demand items. There are also some mattress toppers that are of lower quality but are sold at ridiculously low prices and bolstered by fake reviews and ratings, so please do your research. âœ… More options: The beauty of Amazon is that it offers a wide variety of mattress toppers from different brands to suit all types of budgets.
