Summary: As a welcome bonus, you receive a $200 Amazon Gift Card instantly upon approval exclusively for Prime members, which offsets the majority of the $139 annual membership your first year. According to online reports, and based on the CNBC Select team's experiences, Amazon.com and Amazon Marketplace orders can qualify for 4% back because these purchases code as a bookstore. At CNBC Select, our mission is to provide our readers with high-quality service journalism and comprehensive consumer advice so they can make informed decisions with their money. While CNBC Select earns a commission from affiliate partners on many offers and links, we create all our content without input from our commercial team or any outside third parties, and we pride ourselves on our journalistic standards and ethics.
