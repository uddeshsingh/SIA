Summary: IntelÂ released aÂ teaser video over the Thanksgiving holiday break showing whatâs obviously a graphics card of some kind. Team Blue has triedÂ pushing its discrete GPUsÂ for a few years, and itsÂ Alchemist lineup, like the A580, is already entrenched for budget-end buyers. Plenty of unconfirmed rumors on the Chinese social media appÂ Weibo mention synthetic benchmarks, but perhaps the best we could claim is that Intelâs GPU could match theÂ performance of the Nvidia Geforce RTX 4060 Ti. Intelâs mobile and desktop offerings will support the companyâs XeSS upscaling tech, the most recent super sampling technology compared to AMDâs FSR and Nvidiaâs DLSS. Intelâs latest Arrow Lake desktop processors also promise good gaming performance without needing a discrete GPU.
