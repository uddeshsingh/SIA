Summary: This AI frenzy has sent a handful of tech companies soaring, making S&P gains heavily dependent on their performance. But according to Siegel, the so-called Magnificent 7 stocks — which include names such as Amazon, Nvidia, and Meta — are starting to lag. A lot will depend on future bond yields, as rising rates will likely cap risk assets in 2025, the bank said. Although tech has been the S&P 500's big catalyst this year, Donald Trump's election has helped drive even steeper gains in recent weeks. "Maybe the Mag 7 will do nothing next year, and those small and mid-sized caps, stocks — which are really so undervalued compared to the others — are finally going to have their day in the sun," Siegel said.
