Summary: Driving the parabolic move are the company's graphics processing units (GPUs), which quickly became the gold standard for powering artificial intelligence (AI). Many of the world's biggest tech companies continue to invest heavily to upgrade their infrastructure to handle the rigors of AI -- and for most of them, that means stocking up on Nvidia's state-of-the-art processors. The company has been working to ramp up production of the Blackwell processors and has previously said it expects to ship "several billion dollars" of these chips in its fiscal 2025 fourth quarter, which ends in late January. A crucial detail hiding in plain sight Nvidia has made no bones about the robust demand, with big tech companies jockeying to be among the first to receive these next-generation AI-centric chips. Management has historically been conservative with its estimates, so we can probably expect a gradual increase in the supply of these top-end chips, which will be the catalyst for ramping up Blackwell sales as the year progresses.
Financial_Events: ["This has fueled revenue that jumped 480% and net income that surged 1,270% since the start of 2023.\nInvestors shouldn't expect growth of that magnitude to continue, but there's plenty of evidence that Nvidia still has plenty of gas in the tank", '27), revenue of $35.1 billion soared 94% year over year, while its adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $0.81 surged 103%', "The results were well ahead of management's forecast, which called for revenue growth of 79%.\nManagement was clear about what fueled the impressive showing", 'Much of that revenue was derived from the company\'s Hopper architecture, the foundation for its H200 Tensor Core GPU, and its GH200 Grace Hopper Superchip -- which are currently powering many of the world\'s data centers and AI infrastructure.\nAlthough these processors are currently the benchmark, they\'re about to be supplanted by Nvidia\'s Blackwell architecture, which represents the next generation of its AI-centric chips.\nThe company has been working to ramp up production of the Blackwell processors and has previously said it expects to ship "several billion dollars" of these chips in its fiscal 2025 fourth quarter, which ends in late January.\nA crucial detail hiding in plain sight\nNvidia has made no bones about the robust demand, with big tech companies jockeying to be among the first to receive these next-generation AI-centric chips', 'During the earnings call, chief financial officer Colette Kress said, "Blackwell demand is staggering, and we are racing to scale supply to meet the incredible demand." In her written commentary, she added (emphasis mine), "Both Hopper and Blackwell systems have certain supply constraints, and the demand for Blackwell is expected to exceed supply for several quarters in fiscal 2026." For context, Nvidia\'s fiscal 2026 kicks off in late January.\nThe resulting pent-up demand could act as a springboard for Nvidia sales heading into next year.\nI\'m not the only one who thinks so', "As the supply of these next-gen processors increases, so too will the company's revenue, since greater production means more chips available to sell", "This will, in turn, supercharge already robust profits, fueling a surge in its stock price.\nTo be clear, we don't know exactly when the supply constraints will ease, but Nvidia has a vested interest in working through the bottleneck as quickly as possible"]
