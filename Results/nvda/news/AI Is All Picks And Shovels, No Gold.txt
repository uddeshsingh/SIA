Summary: From IBM’s Watson to ChatGPT’s ability to mimic human conversation, we’ve come a long way in “narrow AI” advancements. Last year, two paths emerged: bet on the builders (companies creating AI products) or the suppliers (the “pick and shovel” providers). Mark Twain famously quipped, “When everyone is looking for gold, it’s a good time to be in the pick and shovel business.” Nvidia, as a supplier of GPUs, has become a cornerstone of AI infrastructure. This is little-followed Australian company is using off-the-shelf components to create brain-inspired systems (neuromorphic computing) that are dramatically more efficient—and much cheaper. AI-related stocks are riding high, but a large selloff could be on the horizon as the Great Enlightenment and Better Mousetrap gain momentum.
