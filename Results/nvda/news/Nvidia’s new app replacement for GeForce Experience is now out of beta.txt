Summary: The Nvidia app originally went into beta earlier this year, and it’s now feature complete enough for the beta label to be removed and for the app to soon be bundled with GeForce drivers. The Nvidia app includes a redesigned and improved overlay, with support for 4K 120fps AV1 video capture, Nvidia’s AI-powered RTX game filters, and an improved customizable statistic overlay. Just like GeForce Experience before it, the Nvidia app includes optimal playable settings for games and it even includes a number of options that were previously only available in the Nvidia Control Panel app. “In future updates, we’ll continue to add remaining NVIDIA Control Panel options like Surround and Multiple Display Mode settings, along with new features and further enhancements,” says the GeForce team in a blog post. “With the official launch of Nvidia app today, migration of GeForce Experience and Nvidia RTX Experience features is complete, and the new app will soon be optionally bundled as part of our Game Ready Driver and Studio Ready Drivers,” says Nvidia.
