Summary: If you do have a small case, you'll find smaller models of the Radeon RX 7700 XT that are similarly recommendable, with performance that's still competitive with Nvidia's GeForce RTX 4060 Ti for only a slightly higher price. Relatively high power consumption Lackluster performance in older titles Intel's been striving to break into the graphics-card market, and while its attempts so far have been met with mixed results, its Arc A580 deserves special mention. (Credit: Michael Justin Allen Sexton) Being the CPU giant it is, Intel has been producing integrated graphics processors that work on its chips since the late 1990s, and has enjoyed a long history in the industry. You'll see a lot of board partners at this point as you shop, including ASRock, Asus, Biostar, Colorful, Galax, Gigabyte, Inno3D, MSI, Palit, PowerColor, PNY, Sapphire, XFX, and Zotac. AMD and Nvidia both have older graphics processors floating around on store shelves that lack ray tracing support, and you may see these while shopping, but they are best avoided at this point except as budget buys.
