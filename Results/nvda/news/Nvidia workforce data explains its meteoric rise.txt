Summary: Nvidia recruiters are now swamped at conferences, and platforms like Reddit and Blind are full of eager posters wondering how to land a job or at least get an interview at the company, which has around 30,000 employees. Huang famously has dozens of direct reports and eschews one-on-one meetings, preferring to call out mistakes in public rather than saving harsh feedback for private conversation, so that everyone can learn. Beginning in 2006, long before using graphics processing units to run AI models was commonplace, Nvidia invested in building a programming software layer called compute unified device architecture (CUDA). CUDA is the main element that keeps AI builders from easily or willingly switching to competing hardware like AMD's MI325 and Amazon's Trainium chips. Nvidia's stats are in line with the industry totals for female representation, but ahead of the pack when it comes to women in technical and management positions.
