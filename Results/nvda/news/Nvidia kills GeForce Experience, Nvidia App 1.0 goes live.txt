Summary: This marks the first step toward creating a single, unified application that will eventually replace both GeForce Experience and the Nvidia Control Panel. Accessing key features is significantly faster and easier, with a more modern feel than the outdated Control Panel. Information about connectors and display capabilities remains accessible, and the larger font size is easier to read on high-resolution monitors. An interface that consolidates all display settings into a single, fast-access page is a huge improvement, and we already see Nvidia working towards that in the current app. Important driver settings – frame rate caps, DSR, G-Sync, Vsync, and others – are included in the app's more accessible and user-friendly interface.
