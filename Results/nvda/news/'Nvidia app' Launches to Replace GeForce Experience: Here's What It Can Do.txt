Summary: The app, first previewed in February, is meant to be a "unified GPU control center," which can also automatically optimize PC games for your Nvidia graphics card. Like with GeForce Experience, the new overlay will appear when you press ALT+Z, giving you an easy way to take screenshots, record videos, or augment a game's visuals with an AI-powered filter. For example, you can use a filter to play a game in black-and-white, make the visuals appear like a watercolor painting, or increase the vibrance to HDR fidelity. Another change is a new "Performance" tab, which can monitor your GPU’s current statistics and even calibrate its voltage, power, and temperature limits. Helldivers 2, God of War Ragnarok, and Baldur’s Gate 3 were notably absent from the GPU optimization feature until we ran the games.
