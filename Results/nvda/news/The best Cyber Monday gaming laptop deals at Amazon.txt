Summary: Amazon was the dark horse of this year's Cyber Weekend laptop deals, undercutting other tech retailers when it came to discounts on popular Apple MacBooks and Microsoft Surface devices. The gaming laptop deals it's still offering on Cyber Monday aren't quite as competitive as those you'll see at Best Buy, which has a better selection of models at a variety of price points. Read on for a comprehensive list of Amazon's best Cyber Monday deals on gaming laptops — including an unprecedented discount on a variant of Mashable's current favorite budget machine. Former Mashable Tech Editor Kim Gedeon tested a $999.99 configuration of the Acer Nitro V 15 last year and rated it a 4.7/5, applauding its quiet keyboard, its sharp design — "the perfect balance of fun and serious," she wrote — and its solid performance. The model that Amazon has on sale as a Cyber Monday deal has a better CPU and GPU than our testing unit, the same amount of RAM, and half the storage.
