Summary: AI infrastructure firm Nebius Group NBIS.O on Monday said it was raising $700 million in a private placement from investors including Nvidia NVDA.O, Accel and some accounts managed by Orbis Investments. Nebius, which emerged in July following a $5.4 billion deal to split the domestic and international assets of Russian internet giant Yandex YNDX.MM, is joining a drive to build the infrastructure underpinning artificial intelligence. Trading in Nasdaq-listed Yandex was suspended soon after Russia's invasion of Ukraine, with Nebius eventually reviving the listing as part of the asset split. Volozh said the $700 million financing would give Nebius additional firepower to build clusters of graphics processing units (GPUs), cloud platforms and other tools for AI developers faster and on a larger scale. Invest wisely: Best online brokers Nebius is leasing data center space in Kansas City, Missouri, and may expand further in the United States, where more than half of the company's clients are based, Volozh told reporters.
