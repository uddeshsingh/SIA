Summary: After a 52% plunge in its stock price so far in 2024, a 6% revenue drop paired with a whopping $16.6 billion loss in the latest quarter, Intel’s board ousted CEO Pat Gelsinger, according to CNBC. The AI chip designer’s stock added 186% this year, its revenue soared 94% and the company’s net margin was a whopping 55% in the third quarter, according to my November Forbes post. The culprit for Intel’s woes comes from a different place — an organizational structure and compensation system that pits internal fiefdoms against each other, says an industry expert who requested anonymity to maintain his relationship with the company. “With Dave and MJ’s leadership, we will continue to act with urgency on our priorities: simplifying and strengthening our product portfolio and advancing our manufacturing and foundry capabilities while optimizing our operating expenses and capital,” noted Yeary’s statement. “There don’t seem to be any easy answers here, so whoever winds up filling the slot looks in for a tough ride,” Sanford C. Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon wrote in a December 2 note featured by the Times.
