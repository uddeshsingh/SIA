Summary: The ‘Oracle of Omaha’ is a value investor — he tends to buy equity in businesses that are trading at attractive valuations, and preferably have an economic moat — in simpler terms, an enduring competitive advantage. Throughout the latter half of 2024, he has been notably restrained, or even bearish — Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: BRK.A) has been a net seller of stocks for the last eight quarters, and Buffett currently maintains a record-breaking cash pile. It remains to be seen whether a market correction is in the making and if the ‘Oracle of Omaha’ is right on that account — what’s even more interesting, is that the billionaire could have made another of his seldom-seen mistakes by slashing his stake in a company whose stock is currently surging. Berkshire Hathaway first invested in the cosmetics company back in Q2 2024 — the exact dates are not known per disclosure rules, but in that span of time, ULTA stock was trading between $439 and $376. While there is a chance that a profit was made on the sale, it’s slim and would have required precise timing — which is not exactly a hallmark of Buffett’s preferred investment style.
