Description: As demand for clean electricity to run data centers increases, operators are considering nuclear energy. But the path to power has a few roadblocks.

Summary: “The explosive growth of new hyperscale data centers to implement [generative AI] is creating an insatiable demand for power that will exceed the ability of utility providers to expand their capacity fast enough,” said Bob Johnson, vice president analyst at Gartner. “In turn, this threatens to disrupt energy availability and lead to shortages, which will limit the growth of new data centers for genAI and other uses from 2026.” While sources like wind and solar provide some relief, they are constrained, noted Jay Dietrich, research director of sustainability at Uptime Institute. However some may be considering running their own installations—during Oracle’s earnings call in September, CTO Larry Ellison said the company has acquired building permits for three SMRs to power a data center with more than a gigawatt of AI compute capacity in an undisclosed location. Google partner Kairos, for example, works with molten fluoride salt, which, said Peterson Corio, “in particular enhances safety because, unlike water-cooled reactors, it does not need to be highly pressurized, and it solidifies at ambient temperature.” On the other hand, SMR manufacturer and nuclear fuel recycler Oklo, which is backed by OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, builds low-output (15MW or 50MW per unit) SMRs that are cooled with liquid metal. FERC and its stakeholders’ concerns have been two-fold: the impact of data centers sucking up excessive amounts of power, thus causing shortages for other customers and potentially raising rates, and the fact that co-located loads would not be paying for the necessary maintenance and expansion of the grid.
