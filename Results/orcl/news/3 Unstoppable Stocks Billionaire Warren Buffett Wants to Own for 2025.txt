Summary: The Oracle of Omaha's consistent outperformance of the benchmark S&P 500 spanning almost six decades has led to investors closely monitoring his trading activity and, sometimes, riding his coattails to big gains. The company's newest five-year plan, dubbed "Hungry for MORE," promotes new food items, leans on technology to increase output and make products more consistent, and leverages its top-notch franchisees to grow the brand. For instance, global energy companies were forced to slash their capital expenditures for roughly three years due to historic demand uncertainty during the COVID-19 pandemic. When coupled with Russia's invasion of Ukraine and the uncertainties this leads to for Europe's energy needs, it creates a perfect scenario for upstream and integrated operators to benefit from. It generates a disproportionately high percentage of its sales and operating cash flow from drilling, which means a higher price for crude oil can lead to an outsized bottom-line benefit for the company.
