Summary: If there's proof that a diet rich in fruits and vegetables is the key to a long life, former Dole Food owner David Murdock, now 101 years old, is it. Murdock has been a pescatarian since 1985, eating a diet rich in fruits and vegetables, drinking several smoothies a day and, according to The New York Times, aims to live until 125. This Jeff Bezos-backed startup will allow you to become a landlord in just 10 minutes, with minimum investments as low as $100 for properties like the Byer House from Stranger Things. Despite his age, Murdock, a self-made billionaire, only used his Lanai residence as a vacation home, staying full-time in Lake Sherwood, Los Angeles. He started in the produce business relatively late in his career in 1985 when he bought Castle & Cooke, a Hawaii real-estate firm that owned Dole and most of Lanai.
