Summary: Several studies have shown limited to no success of brokerage recommendations in guiding investors to pick stocks with the best price increase potential. As a result of the vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover, their analysts tend to rate it with a strong positive bias. This means that the interests of these institutions are not always aligned with those of retail investors, giving little insight into the direction of a stock's future price movement. It would therefore be best to use this information to validate your own analysis or a tool that has proven to be highly effective at predicting stock price movements. In contrast, the Zacks Rank is a quantitative model allowing investors to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions.
