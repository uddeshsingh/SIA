Summary: If your family was an early adopter of PC technology like mine, you might remember booting up your computer to doodle in Paint or try your hand at Minesweeper. One notable success from the Windows phone was the voice assistant Cortana, though Microsoft also discontinued it despite its similar level of accuracy to Google. At the same time, Microsoft already had a tool (a personal information manager software system) called Outlook, so things got a bit messy there. There's even a Windows app for LinkedIn if you want to skip the browser experience, although it didn't earn rave reviews at first, and Microsoft has ended up removing some less-used features over the years. Given Microsoft's (well, everyone's) interest in AI tools lately, it's not entirely surprising that the company is using personal data pulled from LinkedIn for training purposes.
