Summary: If you’re one of the 850 million Microsoft users stubbornly sticking to Windows 10, despite all the efforts to push you (and a technically compliant PC) over to Windows 11, then you can now pay $30 to delay Windows 10 end of support back a year to October 2026. But Microsoft is not backing down beyond that, and there’s more bad news if you want to keep Windows 10 as long as possible. “After October 14, 2025, Microsoft will no longer provide free software updates from Windows Update, technical assistance, or security fixes for Windows 10. Your PC will still work, but we recommend moving to Windows 11.” This is just the latest move by Microsoft to accelerate the push to Windows 11, which has been famously lagging previous OS upgrades. The good news is that the rate of Windows 11 is noticeably increasing—finally, with some 50 million users switching over the last two months.
