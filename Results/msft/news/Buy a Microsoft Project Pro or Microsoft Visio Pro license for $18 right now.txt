Summary: ZDNET's recommendations are based on many hours of testing, research, and comparison shopping. We gather data from the best available sources, including vendor and retailer listings as well as other relevant and independent reviews sites. And we pore over customer reviews to find out what matters to real people who already own and use the products and services weâ€™re assessing. When you click through from our site to a retailer and buy a product or service, we may earn affiliate commissions. Indeed, we follow strict guidelines that ensure our editorial content is never influenced by advertisers.
