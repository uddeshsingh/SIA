Summary: Well, two of those games are Crackdown 1 & 2, and there's been lots of social media talk today about them being free - so we thought we'd bring them to your attention once again. Xbox influencer Klobrille has posted about them recently and got quite a few interactions - even they themselves weren't aware that the two games were free to claim! If you check the above store links, both of these games have a bunch of additional DLC that's also free to claim. Even if you have the games themselves, it's worth adding these DLC packs to your account too - in case they're taken down at any stage in future. Anyway, if you weren't aware of this pair of freebies, we hope you enjoy these classic Crackdown games - entirely free on Xbox!
