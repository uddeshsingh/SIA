Summary: The software giant quietly announced it’s making Copilot Pro features part of its Microsoft 365 Personal and Family subscriptions last week, but only in Australia, New Zealand, Malaysia, Singapore, Taiwan, and Thailand for now. We’ve spent that time adding new features, improving performance, and listening carefully to customer feedback,” says Microsoft in a press release spotted by ZDNet. “The credits will also apply to apps like Paint, Photos, and Notepad on Windows.” If you have a Microsoft 365 Family subscription in one of these select markets, only the subscription owner will get access to Copilot and it cannot be shared with other family members. That’s a lot less than the $33 AUD Microsoft wanted for Copilot Pro in Australia previously.
