Summary: The official Xbox Game Pass X (Twitter) account shared on Monday that players can soon look forward to Crash Team Racing Nitro-Fueled joining the service on Dec. 4, 2024. This remastered effort was developed by Beenox, a team that often provides support work on other Activision Blizzard titles, including the Call of Duty franchise. Crash Team Racing launched on Xbox One, PlayStation 4, and Nintendo Switch, though oddly enough, no PC version was ever released.
