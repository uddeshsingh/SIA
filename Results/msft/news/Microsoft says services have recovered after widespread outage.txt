Title: Microsoft says services have recovered after widespread outage

Summary: Microsoft services have recovered after tens of thousands of users reported its products, including Outlook and Teams, had stopped working. It is also a reminder of how much so many of us rely on Big Tech to help us run our lives and our businesses with products we can't control when they go wrong. Systems and networks are always more vulnerable when maintenance or upgrades are under way, as there's more potential for the tiniest thing to either go wrong or not to plan - and the ripple effects, as we've seen today, can be widespread. Microsoft Teams, for example, is used by more than 280 million people globally, primarily in businesses and schools, where it can be of critical importance for calls, meetings and general service organisation. Some users shared memes celebrating an unexpected break from work, or disappointment that their workplace Teams seemed unaffected.
