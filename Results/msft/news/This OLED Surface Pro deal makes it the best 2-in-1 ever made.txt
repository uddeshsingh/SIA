Summary: It’s a true iPad Pro competitor in just about every aspect — except that it runs Windows and is a much better laptop replacement. Microsoft never sells the device bundled with the Surface Pro keyboard, which you’re definitely going to want, and that adds another $180. But for Cyber Monday, it’s being sold at a significant discount, easily making it the best 2-in-1 laptop ever made. It’s been discounted to $840, which has the Snapdragon X Plus and LCD screen, yes, but comes at quite an inexpensive price for this quality of a device. That was one of my biggest hangups with previous generations of the Surface Pro, which never got enough battery life to make it the ultimate travel device.
