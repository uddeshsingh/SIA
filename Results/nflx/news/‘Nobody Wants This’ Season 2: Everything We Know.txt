Summary: It’s been two months since Nobody Wants This hit Netflix and enchanted the world with an unexpected relationship between a Jewish rabbi (Adam Brody) and a sex podcast host (Kristen Bell). Fans have created thousands of TikTok edits, written full-blown dissertations on the relationship dynamics at play, and even sold out the outfits worn by the characters in the show. For Season 2, Foster and Netflix have brought in Jenni Konner and Bruce Eric Kaplan, two of the creative minds behind HBO’s Girls. “I’m so lucky to be able to continue this story,” Foster told Tudum, “and to do it alongside Jenni Konner and Bruce Eric Kaplan, who I’ve been such a fan of since Girls. … Justice for healthy relationships being the most romantic!” “I am excited beyond belief to be a part of Season 2 of Nobody Wants This, created by the hilarious Erin Foster,” Kaplan added.
