Summary: Collecting all your favourite snacks and drinks, surrounding yourself with comfortable cushions and blankets, and then spending hours in front of a screen can be a truly therapeutic experience. VPNs are security tools that provide protection for your information by creating a private network that hides your real IP address (digital location). The act of hiding your real IP address is what can trick leading streaming sites into thinking you are based in another country. By hiding your real IP address and connecting you to a server in another country, you can watch all your favourite content from that location. ExpressVPN is at the top of this list because it combines essential features with impressive results, but it isnâ€™t the only option available to you.
