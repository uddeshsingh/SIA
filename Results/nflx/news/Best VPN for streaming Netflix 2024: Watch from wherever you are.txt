Summary: VPNs aren’t just useful for keeping your online activities safe and private, they’re also a great way to bypass restrictions on streaming content in other countries. The top VPN providers continue to stay one step ahead of streaming services in a never-ending cat-and-mouse game, ensuring that you always have access to your favorite content no matter where you are. PrivadoVPN: A Swiss-based VPN that comes with decent speeds, good streaming service compatibility, and an excellent free version. How I tested I judge VPNs on a variety of criteria including server network, connection speeds, privacy protections, ease-of-use, additional features, and cost. In regards to unblocking capabilities, I connect to multiple servers around the world with each VPN and try to access content on all major streaming services such as Netflix, Amazon Prime, HBO Max, Hulu, Disney Plus, and more.
