Summary: Jamie Foxx has, for the most part, been largely absent from the spotlight since suffering a mysterious health scare back in April 2023, though he did return to host Beat Shazam after having Nick Cannon as replacement. Fans are waiting for his feature film return Back in Action to hit the Netflix’s 2025 premiere schedule, but first we’ll see the comedy star strutting his stuff on stage for the streaming stand-up special What Had Happened Was. But that didn’t stop friends, fans and followers from chiming in with lots of loving support, with Oscar winner Halle Berry as a stand-out amongst the comments. She led the twisty 2024 horror Never Let Go after co-starring with Mark Wahlberg in the Netflix action comedy The Union, and has upcoming projects with Angelina Jolie and Chris Hemsworth on the way. Other Celebrities Also Shared The Love For Jamie Foxx's New Special Halle Berry is obviously worthy of singling out here, but she’s far from the only familiar face to have spoken out in support of What Had Happened Was.
