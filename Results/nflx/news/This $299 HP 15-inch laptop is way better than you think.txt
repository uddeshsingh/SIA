Summary: What's neat is IF you have a bit more budget you can actually customize this laptop at HP.com and improve RAM (up to 16GB), storage (up to 1TB), CPU (up to a Core i7 P-processor), and even the display (up to Full HD) to something you may prefer. This HP 15 Laptop is great for general family use, as a first or second house computer, couch surfing, students, or anyone who needs to get the basics done, such as Office, email, writing, web browsing, watching YouTube/Netflix, and other productivity tasks. But with a Core i5, an SSD for storage, and fast RAM, when you combine that with a full HD display, you’ll get a laptop that feels like something much more, and that’s what matters for day-to-day use. While Black Friday and Cyber Monday tend to start earlier each year, the worldwide sales event often ends on a similar note. It's best to take advantage of sales you're interested in the moment you spot them to avoid stock shortages and limited-time discounts, but Cyber Monday does frequently boast its own batch of last-minute deals separate from Black Friday.
