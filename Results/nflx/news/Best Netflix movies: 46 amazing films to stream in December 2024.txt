Summary: Based on Erich Maria Remarque’s landmark novel of the same name (which was first adapted into a feature film in 1930), this German-language movie tells the story of a young German soldier (Felix Kammerer) whose naïve expectations of fighting for his country are shattered by war’s harrowing reality. Shot entirely using stop-motion (in a manner akin to Netflix series The House), del Toro’s darker adaptation is set in 1930s Italy during Mussolini’s fascist regime and features a star-studded voice cast who bring vivacity, levity, menace, and more to each of the films' distinct characters.
