Summary: Streaming giant Netflix said Saturday that 60 million households tuned in live to watch YouTuber-turned-prizefighter Paul, 27, cruise to a unanimous decision over Tyson, the 58-year-old former heavyweight champion, at AT&T Stadium in Arlington, Texas. In addition, Netflix said 50 million households globally watched the co-main event, which saw Katie Taylor retain her undisputed women's lightweight championship with a controversial unanimous decision over Amanda Serrano. "The boxing mega-event dominated social media, shattered records and even had our buffering systems on the ropes," Netflix said Saturday. Tyson suffered an ulcer flare-up on an airline flight over the summer, leading him to postpone a fight that was originally scheduled to take place July 20. Nielsen said the Kansas City Chiefs' 25-22 overtime victory over the San Francisco 49ers in last season's Super Bowl averaged 123.7 million viewers across TV and streaming platforms, making it the most-watched program in television history.
