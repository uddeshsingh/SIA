Summary: And let me tell you, my kids and I had two completely different experiences watching this 10-part series of unfortunate events unfold as Atkinson’s house-sitting character went to great lengths to kill a pesky bee. But don't let this make it seem like I hated Man vs. Bee or was a complete wreck after each episode, as the humor, as well as the charm of Rowan Atkinson's character, made it a delight. In the case of Man vs. Bee, my kids wasted no time and would start yelling at me to press play so they didn’t have to wait those additional five seconds before the next chapter kicked off. Like a lot of those great kid-friendly comedies, the show was also full of hilarious, chaotic, and unforgettable moments, even if I could feel my blood pressure rising at times. Though Man vs. Bee was canceled and we’ll never get to see Trevor battle that pesky bug in the future, there are plenty of upcoming 2025 Netflix movies and shows that will hopefully bring just as much enjoyment, laughs, and (small and manageable) fits of nervousness to my house very soon.
