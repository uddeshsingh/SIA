Summary: In fact, it’s rare even a single week passes without one of Netflix’s original shows returning for a new season, but it can be difficult to keep track of them all. In this series, couples “break up” and enter into trial marriages with someone new in order to find out if their original relationship is worth fighting for. The new season features couples Zaina and JR, Nick and Sandy, Mariah and Caleb, Aria and Scotty, Chanel and Micah, and David and Vanessa. “Following the confrontation with Riz, Legoshi decides to leave school and begins living alone in Beast Apartments,” reads the synopsis for season 3. Around this time, current BEASTAR Yahya pursues Melon, a violent criminal who seeks pleasure in murdering beasts.
