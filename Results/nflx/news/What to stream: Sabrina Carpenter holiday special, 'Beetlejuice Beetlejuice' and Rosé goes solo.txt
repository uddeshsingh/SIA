Summary: In her review, AP’s Jocelyn Noveck called it “a joyously rendered sequel that sometimes makes sense, and sometimes doesn’t, but just keeps rollicking.” — A lowkey reunion of “Love Actually” writer-director Richard Curtis and one of that film’s stars, Bill Nighy, is part of the new Netflix animated movie “That Christmas” (streaming Wednesday). The film was co-written by Curtis (it’s based on his series of Christmas books) and features Nighy as the voice of Lighthouse Bill, one of the Wellington-on-Sea townspeople grappling with a winter blizzard. — Lauren Mayberry, vocalist and percussionist from the Scottish pop band Chvrches, makes her solo debut with “Vicious Creature.” The 12 tracks veer from the coffee-house folk of “Anywhere But Dancing” to the punky “Punch Drunk,” the dance-pop of “Change Shapes” and stuttering glam of “Sorry, Etc.” “It’s a mission statement of all things that you like,” she tells us in an interview. I cannot wait for you to listen to this little journal of mine.” — AP Entertainment Writer Mark Kennedy — In their new Netflix series “Black Doves,” Keira Knightley and Ben Whishaw play old friends who also happen to be a spy and an assassin, that team up to solve a murder (and get revenge) at Christmas. — Margo Martindale stars in the new Prime Video series “The Sticky,” as a down-on-her-luck woman on the brink of financial ruin who finds herself in a crime ring stealing, of all things, millions of dollars’ worth of maple syrup.
