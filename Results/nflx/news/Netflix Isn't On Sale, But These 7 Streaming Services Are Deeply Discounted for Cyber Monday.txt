With HBO originals like House of The Dragon, The Penguin, Hacks, and Dune: Prophecy along with classic hit series like The Wire, The Sopranos, and Sex in the City, it's no wonder why Max is so acclaimed. That means you binge the greatest shows from the golden age of TV, for half of 2025 at a total price that's cheaper than two months of Max under a normal subscription. You can spend the majority of 2025 watching Yellowstone and other hits like The Office, NFL's Sunday Night Football, the Premier League, SNL, WWE and so much more for as low as $1.99.
