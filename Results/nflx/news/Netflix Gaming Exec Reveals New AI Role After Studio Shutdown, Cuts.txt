Summary: "Many view this technology with fear, but I am a game-maker at heart and I see its potential to unlock all of us, to create mind-blowing new experiences for players, to lift us to new heights," Verdu wrote on LinkedIn. As of September 2023, fewer than 1% of Netflix's subscribers had played its games, per data from the analytics firm Apptopia. Co-CEO Greg Peters said during Netflix's second-quarter earnings call that the company was happy with its progress and that user engagement on games had tripled in 2023. The company sees games as a tool to boost subscriber retention to its streaming services, which could explain why Netflix hasn't introduced advertising as a way of monetizing them. He wrote that after Netflix games started to scale up, he recognized his strength was in running smaller teams.
