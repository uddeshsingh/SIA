Summary: Other movies have lasted two to three weeks in the top ten, which indicates that the cinematic universe has yet to make a splash like other crossover franchises like Marvel and Star Wars. Chabert played high school gossiper Gretchen Wieners in that film, while Lohan was its protagonist, Cady Heron, which may be why "Hot Frosty" is connected to "Falling for Christmas." When Kathy puts on the TV, the scene from "Falling for Christmas" where Lohan's character Sierra wakes up from a coma plays on the screen. Related stories During a tense conversation in "Hot Frosty," a TV in the background shows a scene from "Single All The Way" where Jennifer Coolidge's character, Aunty Sandy, performs in a nativity play. "Hot Frosty" also references Netflix's "Christmas Prince" franchise when Kathy takes Jack to the doctor to figure out why he is ice cold.
